Synchiropus moyeri, commonly known as Moyer's dragonet, is a species of fish in the family Callionymidae, the dragonets. It is found in the western Pacific Ocean.[2]

This species reaches a length of 7.5 cm (3.0 in).[3]

The fish is named in honor of marine biologist Jack T. Moyer (1929-2004), who was director of the Tatsuo Tanaka Memorial Biological Station at Miyake-jima, Japan, for his “noteworthy contributions to the knowledge of the fishes of Miyake-jima, and in deep appreciation of the encouragement and logistic support he has provided to both of the authors”.[4]

The picturesque dragonet (Synchiropus picturatus) is a brightly colored member of the dragonet family native to the Indo-West Pacific: Philippines, eastern Indonesia and northwest Australia. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade, where it is commonly known as the spotted mandarin, psychedelic mandarin or target mandarin.

The picturesque dragonet may grow to a size of 7 cm in length. They have thick slime on their skin that inhibits many types of parasitic infection and minimizes the risk of disease following stress or physical trauma. This seems to help protect them from some other more aggressive fish.

Synchiropus picturatus is one of only two vertebrates known to have blue colouring because of cellular pigment, the other being the closely related Synchiropus splendidus. The name ""cyanophore"" was proposed for the blue chromatophores, or pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells. In all other known cases, the colour blue comes from thin-film interference from piles of flat, thin and reflecting purine crystals.[1]

澳大利亚鳚,Ecsenius australianus,澳洲异齿鳚,喉鳍目,"

The Australian blenny (Ecsenius australianus) is a small marine blennioid fish of the genus Ecsenius. They are small and reddish brown with a white ventral side. Australian blennies inhabit the shallow marine waters of the tropics.[2] They are often found along the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea of Australia.

This species is believed to be most closely related to E. fourmanoiri.[3] Similarities between these two species include ""broad, darkly dusky bands and stripes"" and ""dark opercular margin[s]"", which are not found in other members of the ""Opsifrontalis Group"".[3] Preserved specimens also bear similarity to E. opsifrontalis. However, E. australianus differ from E. opsifrontalis and E. fourmanoiri by their number of fins rays and vertebrae.[3]

Australian blennies are small fish, reaching lengths of only 6 centimetres (2.4 in).[4] The dorsal two-thirds of the body is reddish-brown, with white spots forming two rows. The ventral third is white in colour.[2] A reddish-brown stripe with white edges passes from the rear end of the operculum (gill covering) through the eyes.[2] The colour of the stripes can vary by specimen, between bright orange-red and pinkish brown. Towards the posterior end, colouration turns grey.[3]

The dorsal fin has twelve spines and 13–15 soft rays.[3] The anal fin has two spines and 15–17 soft rays. The pectoral fin usually has 13 soft rays but can occasionally have 14. The tail (caudal) fin possesses 14 rays.[3]

Australian blennies are oviparous and lay eggs. The eggs develop at the bottom of the body of water and are adhesive.[4]

Australian blennies are distributed in the western Pacific Ocean, occurring in the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea.[2] They are associated with coral reefs and occur in shallow waters along the northern Great Barrier Reef of Australia.[4] Whilst they are currently restricted to the northern Great Barrier Reef region, their range may expand southwards with those of several other similarly distributed species as temperatures increase due to climate change.[5]

Petroscirtes ewaensis Brock, 1948

Plagiotremus ewaensis, the Ewa blenny, Ewa fangblenny or the blue-stripe blenny, is a reef fish belonging to the Blenniidae family. This species of combtooth blenny can be found in coral reefs and is an endemic species to the Hawaiian Islands.[2]

This species is orange or reddish-brown in color, with blue and black stripes along the length of their body.[3] They can grow up to about 4 in (100 mm).[4] The Ewa fang blenny gets its name from their sharp fangs.[3] They have fangs which they use to bite off flesh from their food sources and defending themselves from predators.[3][5] If they get eaten, the fang blenny will bite the inside of their predator’s mouth until the predator allows them to escape.[3] The Ewa fang blenny is a carnivore, wandering the reef to feed on scales, skin, and mucus from bigger fish.[4][3] This species is a secondary consumer, which means that they also feed on predators, like sharks.[4][6]

The Ewa fang blenny is an endemic species that currently exists in the Hawaiian Islands. [7] This species resides in the reef in sea depths of 4 to 55 meters and temperatures ranging from 76.82 °F - 80.24 °F (or 24.9°C - 26.8°C). [7] The fang blenny will make use of empty worm snail holes in the reef as protection when predators try to attack.[8]

帆背远鳚,Aidablennius sphynx,地中海远鳚,喉鳍目,"

The sphinx blenny (Aidablennius sphynx) is a species of combtooth blenny, and the only species in the genus Aidablennius.[3] It was described by Achille Valenciennes in 1836, originally under the genus Blennius,[4] and was later reassigned under ""Aidablennius"" by Gilbert Percy Whitley in 1947. It is a subtropical blenny known from Morocco, in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, and also from the Mediterranean and Black Seas.[5] Sphinx blennies inhabit shallow, rocky waters in the littoral zone, with sunlight exposure. They feed primarily on benthic algae, weeds and invertebrates.[6] Sphinx blennies can measure up to 8 centimetres (3.1 in) long in total length.[5]

In mating, the blennies form distinct pairs, and the females lay up to 7000 eggs in a sitting, which are then guarded in burrows by the males.[7] Males are known to cannibalize dead eggs to prevent infection spread amongst the healthy eggs, although in smaller broods they have also been reported consuming living eggs. It is believed that this is due to limited feeding opportunities for the males during breeding, as a result of their restriction to the nests.[8] FishBase considers the blennies to be of Low Vulnerability, with a reproductive doubling time of less than 15 months.[5]

红绿灯,Paracheirodon innesi,拟唇齿脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

Hyphessobrycon innesi Myers, 1936

The neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi) is a freshwater fish of the characin family (family Characidae) of order Characiformes. The type species of its genus, it is native to blackwater and clearwater streams in the Amazon basin of South America.[2][3] Its bright colouring makes the fish visible to conspecifics in the dark blackwater streams,[4] and is also the main reason for its popularity among freshwater fish hobbyists, with neon tetras being one of the most widely kept tropical fish in the world.[5]

The neon tetra is found in the western and northern Amazon basin in southeastern Colombia, eastern Peru, and western Brazil.[2][3] It lives in waters with a temperature between 20 and 28 °C (68–82 °F) and pH 4–7.5.[2][3] It has a preference for acidic blackwater streams, but also occurs in transparent clearwater streams.[3] It is not found in the whitewater rivers.[3] UN FAO considers P. innesi an introduced species in Singapore[6] and the United States.[7] FAO considers its introduction to Singapore to be ecologically and socioeconomically beneficial, but it is not established there.[6]

The neon tetra has a light-blue back over a silver-white abdomen. The fish is characterized by an iridescent blue horizontal stripe along each side of the fish from its nose to the base of the adipose fin, and an iridescent red stripe that begins at the middle of the body and extends posteriorly to the base of the caudal fin. The fish is partially transparent (including fins) except for these markings. Sexual dimorphism is slight, with the female having a slightly larger belly, and a bent iridescent stripe rather than the male's straight stripe.  During the night, the blue and red become gray or black as the fish rests. It reactivates once it becomes active in the morning.[8] This peculiar change is due to the neon tetras capacity to change the color of its iridescent stripe in response to lighting conditions. In a light-adapted state it is blue-green, likewise in a dark-adapted state its color changes to indigo. This change is produced by guanine crystals in their cells that reflect light. The neon tetra grows to approximately 4 cm (1.5 in) in overall length.[9]

The neon tetra was first imported from South America and was described by renowned ichthyologist George S. Myers in 1936, and named after William T. Innes.[10] P. innesi is one of the most popular aquarium fish, with about 2 million sold in the US each month.[11] Most neon tetras available in the United States are imported from Southeast Asia, where they are farm-raised, or to a lesser extent from Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, where they are collected from the wild.[12] During a single month, an average of 1.8 million neon tetras with an estimated value of $175,000 are imported into the United States for the aquarium trade.[13]  With the exception of home aquarists and a few commercial farms that breed neon tetras experimentally, captive breeding on a commercial scale is nonexistent in the USA.[14]

In the wild they inhabit very soft, acidic waters (pH 4.0 to 4.8)[15] Ideal pH for aquarium is 7.0, but a range of 6.0 to 8.0 is tolerable.[16] They can have a lifespan of as long as ten years,[17] but normally just two to three years in an aquarium.[18]

Neon tetras are considered easy to keep in an aquarium of at least 10 US gallons (38 L; 8.3 imp gal) with a temperature range of between 72–76 °F (22–24 °C), a water pH of between 6.0 and 7.0, GH of below 10 dGH and KH of 1–2 dKH, and under 20 ppm of nitrate.[19]

They are shoaling fish and must be kept in groups of at least six, but will be more active in groups of eight to 12 or more.[20] Neon tetras are best kept in a densely planted tank to resemble their native Amazon environments.

Neon tetras are omnivores and will accept most flake foods, if sufficiently small, but should also have some small foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, which can be stuck to the side of the aquarium, and micropellet food to supplement their diets. A tropical sinking pellet is ideal, as most brands of these include natural color enhancers that bring out the color in neon tetras. Some frozen foods, including frozen blood worms, add variety to their diets.[21]

The male is slender, and the blue line is straighter. The female is rounder, producing a bent blue line. Some aquarists say the females look plumper when viewed from above. However, the straightness of the line and the plumpness of the female might occasionally be due to the eggs she is carrying. A neon tetra can appear slightly plump in the belly due to having overeaten.

Neon tetras need dim lighting, a DH less than one, about 5.5 pH, and a temperature of 75 °F (24 °C) to breed. There also needs to be a lot of tannins in the water. Neon tetras are old enough to breed at 12 weeks.[22]

Breeding neon tetras is considered to be difficult in home aquariums.[23] However, it is becoming more common, with less than 5% of specimens currently sold in America caught in the wild, and more than 1.5 million specimens imported to America each month from fish farms.[24]

Neon tetras are occasionally afflicted by the so-called ""neon tetra disease"" (NTD) or pleistophora disease, a sporozoan disease caused by Pleistophora hyphessobryconis. Despite being a well-known condition, it is generally incurable and often fatal to the fish. However this disease is also generally preventable.[25] The disease cycle begins when microsporidian parasite spores enter the fish after it consumes infected material, such as the bodies of a dead fish, or live food such as tubifex, which may serve as intermediate hosts. The disease is most likely passed by newly acquired fish that have not been quarantined.

Symptoms include restlessness, loss of coloration, lumps on the body as cysts develop, difficulty swimming, curved spines as the disease progresses, and secondary infections, such as fin rot and bloating.[26]

A so-called ""false neon disease"", which is bacterial, shows very similar symptoms. It is impossible for the home aquarist to determine for certain the difference between NTD and false NTD on the basis of visible symptoms alone, without laboratory backup. This disease has also been confused with columnaris (mouth rot, mouth fungus, 'flex').

Generally the best 'treatment' is the immediate removal of diseased fish to preserve the remaining fish, although some occasional successful treatments have been performed that include fish baths and a ""medication cocktail"". The use of a diatom filter, which can reduce the number of free parasites in the water, may help. As with Pleistophora neon tetra disease, prevention is most important and this disease is rare when good preventive measures are performed.[25]

The green neon tetra (P. simulans) and black neon tetra (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) are distinct species—the latter belongs to a different genus—and not color varieties. The cardinal tetra (P. axelrodi) is also a similar species, but its greater extent of red coloring distinguishes it from the neon tetra.[27] The name Hyphessobrycon innesi is an obsolete synonym for P. innesi.

宝莲灯,Paracheirodon axelrodi,阿氏拟唇齿脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

The cardinal tetra (Paracheirodon axelrodi) is a freshwater fish of the family Characidae of order Characiformes. It is native to the upper Orinoco and Negro Rivers in South America. Growing to about 3 cm (1.2 in) total length, the cardinal tetra has the striking iridescent blue line characteristic of the genus Paracheirodon laterally bisecting the fish, with the body below this line being vivid red in color, hence the name ""cardinal tetra"". The cardinal tetra's appearance is similar to that of the closely related neon tetra, with which it is often confused; the neon's red coloration extends only about halfway to the nose, and the neon's blue stripe is a less vibrant blue.

The cardinal tetra is a very popular aquarium fish, but is less widespread than the neon tetra because until recently, it was difficult to breed in captivity. However, many breeders are now producing the fish; in most cases, one can determine if the cardinal tetra is bred or wild-caught due to damaged fins on wild-caught specimens. Some ichthyologists believe fishkeepers should continue to support the sustainable cardinal fishery of the Amazon Basin, since thousands of people are employed in the region to capture fish for the aquarium trade. If those fishermen lost their livelihoods catching cardinals and other tropical fish, they might turn their attention to engaging in deforestation.[3]

American ichthyologist Leonard Peter Schultz described the cardinal tetra in 1956 as Cheirodon axelrodi.[2] The specific epithet honors ichthyologist Herbert R. Axelrod. Hyphessobrycon cardinalis is an obsolete synonym. The fish's common name, cardinal tetra, refers to the brilliant red coloration, reminiscent of a cardinal's robes. P. axelrodi is also often called the red neon tetra.

The species exists in a number of different color forms or phenotypes. A ""gold"" and ""silver-blonde"" form exists in the Rio Negro drainage that has less blue in the longitudinal stripe. The normal form from the Rio Negro drainage has a blue stripe, which extends to the adipose fin, while the Orinoco drainage phenotype has a stripe that stops posterior to the adipose. The Orinoco phenotype may represent a subspecies of P. axelrodi.

The cardinal tetra has bright red ventral parts and an iridescent blue line that runs horizontally along its body. The characteristic iridescence of this and related fishes, such as the neon tetra, is a structural color, caused by refraction of light within guanine crystals that develop within special cells called iridocytes in the subcutaneous layer. The exact shade of blue seen depends on the viewing angle of the viewer relative to the fish - if the viewpoint changes so as to look at the fish more from below, the colour will change hue, becoming more deeply sapphire blue and even indigo. Change of viewpoint to one above the fishes, however, and the color becomes more greenish. Cardinal tetras appear to grow larger in captivity than they do in the wild.[4] They have a large stomach and small gut.[4]

Cardinal tetras are found on the upper Orinoco and the Negro, which are located in Colombia and Venezuela and Brazil, respectively.

The cardinal tetra forages in areas of slow-moving, shallow water. It is predominantly predatory, feeding on tiny animals found on underwater plants, roots, and leaf litter. Creatures commonly eaten include the larvae of chironomid midges and microcrustaceans such as water fleas (Cladocera) of the families Moinidae, Macrotrichidae, and Daphniidae, and copepods of the family Harpacticidae. Other organisms eaten include other fly larvae, insect eggs, rotifers, and testate amoebae.[4]

In the wild, the cardinal tetra swims upstream in large numbers to parts of its native river habitat completely enclosed above by rainforest canopy. Such waters are subject to heavy shading by the rainforest trees, and virtually no sunlight reaches them. Here, the fishes spawn in large aggregations. If the fishes are ready to spawn, the male pursues the female into fine-leaved plants; her fuller outline, which usually indicates the presence of ripe eggs within her reproductive tract, should be readily apparent at this point. If the female is ready, she allows the male to swim alongside her, and together, the pair release eggs and sperm.

The fish might also be effectively an annual species with a lifespan of just a single year in nature. It lives for several years in captivity. For those seeking to breed them in the aquarium, the best way to do so is by mimicking the same natural setup. A study conducted in Manaus, Brazil, subjected cardinal tetras to adverse water conditions for 96 hours. The fish perished at a low temperature of 19.6 °C (67.3 °F) and a high of 33.7 °C (92.7 °F), and pH below 2.9 or above 8.8.[5]

An entire industry is in place in Barcelos on the banks of Brazil's Rio Negro in which the local population catches fish for the aquarium trade. The cardinal fishery here is highly valued by the local people who act as stewards for the environment. The local people may not become involved in potentially environmentally damaging activities, such as deforestation, because they can make a sustainable living from the fishery.[3]

Between the years of 2006 to 2015, over 92,000,000 cardinal tetras were exported from the state of Amazonas, accounting for 64.57% of all ornamental fish exports from the state during this time.[6]

柠檬灯,Hyphessobrycon pulchripinnis,丽鳍鲃脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

The lemon tetra (Hyphessobrycon pulchripinnis) is a species of tropical freshwater fish which originates from South America, belonging to the family Characidae. It is a small tetra growing to 5 cm (2 in) in length. The species is a long established favourite aquarium fish, being introduced to the aquarium in 1932.

The lemon tetra is one of the deeper-bodied tetras, contrasting with slender, torpedo-shaped relations such as the cardinal tetra and the rummy nosed tetra, whose approximate body shape when seen from the side is that of a lozenge,(often referred to as a diamond, is a form of rhombus). The basic body color of an adult specimen is a translucent yellow, with a pearlescent lustre emanating from the scales in particularly fine specimens. The dorsal and anal fin of the fish are marked with black and yellow: specifically, the anal fin is hyaline (glass-like appearance), with a black outer margin, the anterior three or four rays being an intense, acrylic lemon-yellow in hue, while the dorsal fin is principally black with a yellow central patch. The tail fin is mostly hyaline but in fine specimens (particularly alpha males) acquires a gunmetal-blue lustre. The pectoral fins are hyaline whilst the pelvic fins are translucent yellow, becoming more solidly and opaquely yellow with black posterior edges in fine specimens (again, alpha males are particularly notable in this regard). The eye is a notable feature of this fish, the upper half of the iris being an intense red, in some specimens almost gemstone-ruby in appearance. The colour of this part of the iris is an indicator of the health of the fish: if this red colouration fades, or worse still turns grey, then this is an indicator of serious disease in the fish. In common with many characins, the lemon tetra possesses an adipose fin. This fin may acquire a black border, particularly in males, though this is not a reliable characteristic. Black areas of colouration on adult fishes frequently acquire a glossy sheen, enhancing the beauty of the fish.

Determining the gender of the fish is achieved in adult specimens by examining the black outer border of the anal fin. In female specimens, this consists of a fine black line, appearing almost as if drawn onto the fin with a fine pencil. In male specimens, particularly alpha males, the border is conspicuously wider, and in breeding alpha males, can cover up to a third of the total area of the anal fin. This is the only reliable means of differentiating gender in this species - while males frequently have taller and more pointed dorsal fins, some females also possess tall, pointed dorsal fins, and thus this characteristic is not reliable. Ripe females are fuller bodied, particularly when viewed from directly above, as the body cavity expands to accommodate the eggs forming within the female's reproductive tract.

Juvenile fishes are usually translucent with only a hint of the colour of the adult. Additionally, the gender characteristics in juvenile fishes are not fully formed, so differentiating juveniles into male and female individuals is extremely difficult.

The lemon tetra is an Amazon River fish species, first collected from the basin of the Rio Tapajos, near to Santarém, Brazil. The fish can be found in both the Rio Tapajos and stretches of the Amazon proper in this region (the Rio Tapajos joins the Amazon at Santarém).

The lemon tetra inhabits clear waters with a modest to moderate current flow, remaining in shallower waters in close proximity to stands of aquatic plants. The water chemistry is slightly acidic, and the waters are relatively mineral-deficient. Lemon tetras congregate in their chosen waters in large shoals, numbering several thousand individuals, where the black and yellow colouration becomes disruptive from the standpoint of predatory fish species attempting to track an individual fish. The fishes are capable of moving at speed when required, and in a shoal the fishes will, when danger threatens, weave in and out of each other, adding to the visual confusion for a predator. The species preferentially occupies the middle and mid-lower water levels in the wild.

Lemon tetras fare best in a planted aquarium, where they should be kept as schooling fishes, allowing them to replicate their wild behaviour as closely as possible. A minimum of six individuals should be kept in an aquarium, though if space allows, a larger number is preferable, as the species exhibits a marked preference for grouping together in large shoals of its own kind where possible. In a planted aquarium, the Lemon Tetra displays more vivid colouration - juvenile specimens in bare dealer aquaria usually appear 'washed out' in appearance and do not show the full splendour of which this species is capable. The aquarium for this species should be furnished with plant thickets interspersed with open swimming areas where the fishes can display to each other. Suitable companions in an aquarium include other tetra species, small barbs, small danios, small rasboras, Corydoras and Otocinclus catfishes, and in aquaria where space allows, certain species of dwarf cichlid such as the smaller Apistogramma species. Tankmates should be chosen to be peaceful, not too large, and a more natural display results if the companion fishes chosen are other South American species. An aquarium containing large shoals of lemon and cardinal tetras makes a particularly stunning display, the blue and red of the Cardinals contrasting with the brilliant yellow and black of the lemons.

While the preference of the lemon tetra with respect to water chemistry lies within the realm of soft (hardness less than 8° dH) and acidic (pH around 6.6) parameters, the species is notably hardy, and will accommodate itself to a wide range of conditions, the pH range for the fish being from 6.0 to 7.4. Temperature range for the species is 21 to 28 °C (70 to 82 °F), though the species is capable of withstanding water temperatures up to 32 °C (90 °F) for considerable periods of time if the water is well oxygenated. Aeration and good quality filtration should be provided for this fish (and indeed for all aquarium fishes) though the fish is sufficiently hardy to cope with aquarium equipment failures provided these are attended to upon discovery.

Extremes of high pH (8.0 or higher) and hardness should be avoided, as these will subject the Lemon Tetra to potentially life-threatening stress.

Feeding the lemon tetra poses few problems for the aquarist, as the fish readily and eagerly devours all fish foods offered to it. For prime conditioning (especially if captive reproduction is to be attempted) live foods such as Daphnia should be offered. The lemon tetra is particularly fond of live bloodworms (these are the aquatic larvae of Chironomus midges) and will attack this particular food item with a relish that has to be witnessed to be fully appreciated! Prepared foods such as flakes, freeze dried Tubifex worms and similar fare are also devoured avidly.

The lifespan of the lemon tetra in the aquarium can be as much as 8 years, though 6 years is a more typical figure.

Lemon tetras exhibit an interesting behaviour pattern in the aquarium, replicated by several other characin species, in which males will adopt 'landmarks' within the aquarium and use these as places from which to display as maturity approaches. Displays are principally performed between rival males, which position themselves in a slightly head-up posture, unpaired fins held erect to appear as large and as imposing as possible, and swim forwards with 'flicking' movements of the body. If two rival males approach closely, they will then begin to make passes at each other, which to the causal observer look like attacks: this is an entirely ritualised behaviour, best referred to as 'jousting', where the males make darting movements toward each other but pull away at the last moment. No damage is incurred by either contestant in these events, and evenly matched males that are at a similar level in the social hierarchy will continue such behaviour for 30 minutes or more at a time. This behaviour serves not only to establish the social rankings of the males, but also serves as an indicator of reproductive fitness to the watching females.

In the wild, the lemon tetra is a communally spawning fish. Tens of thousands of pairs will spawn together, and choose thickets of fine-leaved aquatic plants as the repository for their fertilised eggs. This behaviour has several ramifications for captive reproduction, as will be duly noted.

When ripe females are receptive, males will court them, after a chase sequence through aquatic foliage in which several males may pursue an individual female, breaking off to pursue a different female as the opportunity arises, resulting in the aquarium in mad dashes hither and thither. Eventually, close observation will see a male court a female in some secluded area of aquatic foliage. The courting gesture of the male consists of a quivering motion, with a head-down posture, and the 'flicking' of the unpaired fins in such a manner as to generate flashes of yellow colouration in the visual field of the female. These flashes will be readily visible to the observing aquarist. If the female is ready to spawn, then the pair will migrate to fine-leaved aquatic plants such as Cabomba or Java Moss, whereupon the pair will adopt a side-by-side position. The release of eggs and sperm is signalled by a quivering motion upon the part of both fishes, followed by an 'explosive' parting of the couple accompanied by the appearance of a cloud of eggs. The eggs are non-adhesive, and fall through the foliage, coming to rest either in thicker foliage at the base of the plants, or on the substrate.

One of the problems presented to the aquarist by this species is that of egg-eating.[2] In the wild, as has already been noted, tens of thousands of pairs spawn simultaneously, and in order to reduce the competition for their own offspring, a pair will turn around and eat some of the eggs being produced by neighbouring spawning pairs. The same instinct, needless to say, manifests itself in the aquarium, but in an aquarium setting, the only eggs present are usually those of the single spawning pair. Consequently, some of the pair's own eggs will be devoured. Special measures to reduce losses through this behaviour are therefore required if the aquarist is interested in obtaining as large a yield of fry as possible. Special 'egg traps' have been devised for the purpose - these may consist of evenly spaced glass rods in a frame, a layer of glass marbles on the aquarium bottom, or some other such device. The purpose of all these designs is the same - to allow eggs to fall through small gaps into a space where they will be beyond the reach of the adults, who are unable to pass through the same gaps. However, the speed of movement of the adult fishes is such that even with an 'egg trap' in place, a small percentage of eggs will still be eaten.

A large adult female in prime condition may produce as many as 300 eggs.

A breeding aquarium for the lemon tetra thus requires good quality filtration and aeration, fine leaved plants, and an 'egg trap' present to prevent large-scale losses because of the aforementioned parental instincts. Temperature should be slowly raised over a period of a few days to 28 °C, the pair conditioned with copious quantities of live foods if possible, and the aquarium should be sited so as to receive illumination by morning sunshine, as this is a well-documented spawning stimulus for the lemon tetra. Parent fishes should be removed from the breeding aquarium and returned to the main aquarium once spawning is complete. Sometimes, best results are obtained by using two males with one female.

Fertile lemon tetra eggs take approximately 72 hours to hatch at 28 °C (82 °F). The fry spend a further 24 to 48 hours absorbing the yolk sac, whereupon they become free-swimming. At this stage, the fry should be fed with infusoria or a special egglayer fry food, and frequent partial water changes (around 10% of the aquarium volume every 24 to 48 hours) initiated. After 7 days, the fry should be ready to feed upon newly hatched Brine Shrimp. The fry appear to be almost transparent at first, with the exception of the eyes, and do not begin to develop the 'lozenge' shape of the adult body until the differentiation of the finfold into the unpaired fins is complete (around 4–6 weeks). Once this process is complete, the fishes are ready to take sifted Daphnia. Maintenance temperature for the fry should be carefully and slowly reduced to around 25 °C (77 °F) once the fishes are thus recognisably miniature versions of the adults. The first signs of black colouration on the unpaired fins may take a further two weeks of more to being manifesting themselves, and it will not be until the fishes are at least 12 weeks old that they will fully represent miniature versions of the parents. Even at this stage, the black colouration of the unpaired fins will be incompletely developed, and it will not be until sexual maturity is achieved (approximately 8 to 9 months after hatching) that the black border on the anal fin will become a reliable gender differentiation characteristic.

When it comes to health and disease concerns Lemon Tetra (Hyphessobrycon pulchripinnis) are relatively hardy but are not immune to common freshwater fish ailments. They are susceptible to diseases such as Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich), which presents as white spots on the skin and fins, and various fungal infections that may manifest as cotton-like growths. Preventative measures include maintaining optimal water quality with regular water changes, ensuring a balanced diet, and avoiding overcrowded conditions that can stress fish and make them more prone to illness. It is also crucial to quarantine new fish before introducing them to an established tank to prevent the spread of disease. With proper care and attention to water quality and nutrition, Lemon Tetras can live a healthy life, contributing to the dynamic ecosystem of a home aquarium.[3]

黑莲灯,Hyphessobrycon heterorhabdus,异纹鲃脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

Hyphessobrycon heterorhabdus, commonly known as the flag tetra or Belgian flag tetra, is a species of freshwater characin fish endemic to Brazil. Belonging to the family Characidae, this species is distinguished by its vibrant coloration and patterns, which have contributed to its popularity in the aquarium trade.[2]

The Flag Tetra, Hyphessobrycon heterorhabdus, exhibits a distinctively elongated and laterally compressed body shape, characteristic of many species within the characin family. One of its most striking features is its vividly red-colored eyes, which contrast sharply with its overall body coloration. Along its lateral line, the fish displays a prominent stripe that integrates black, red, and yellow lines. This unique color pattern bears a resemblance to the national flag of Belgium, from which the common names 'Flag Tetra' and 'Belgian Flag Tetra' are derived.[3]

The coloration of this species not only serves an aesthetic purpose in aquarium settings but also plays a role in intra-species communication and camouflage in its natural habitat. The stripe pattern can vary slightly among individuals, reflecting factors such as age, health, and environmental conditions. These adaptive features illustrate the fish's evolutionary responses to its surroundings and social interactions within schools.[4]

The Flag Tetra (Hyphessobrycon heterorhabdus) is indigenous to the freshwater ecosystems of Brazil, primarily found in the Amazon Basin. This species favors environments that offer a combination of clear and blackwater conditions, indicative of waters that are either transparent or tea-colored due to dissolved organic materials. The preferred habitats are typically characterized by a slow to moderate flow, often within smaller streams, creeks, and tributaries that are shaded by the dense canopy of the rainforest.

These shaded, forested waterways provide a multitude of hiding places and breeding grounds, crucial for the survival and reproduction of the Flag Tetra. The dense vegetation and submerged woody debris found in these habitats not only offer protection from predators but also house a diverse array of microorganisms and invertebrates that form the diet of this species. The water chemistry of their natural habitat tends to be slightly acidic to neutral, with a soft to moderately hard composition, reflecting the decomposing organic matter present in these environments.[5]

The diet of Hyphessobrycon heterorhabdus predominantly consists of small invertebrates and plant matter. In their natural habitat within the Amazon Basin, these fish adapt to a varied diet that includes micro-crustaceans, worms, small insects, and detritus, reflecting the rich biodiversity of their ecosystem. The availability of such food sources is abundant in the slow-moving streams and creeks where they reside, often beneath the dense canopy of the rainforest which contributes to the proliferation of a diverse microfauna.[2]

In addition to animal-based nutrients, Flag Tetras also graze on algae and other plant materials found on submerged surfaces, such as rocks and driftwood. This omnivorous diet is crucial for their growth and overall health, providing a balanced intake of proteins, vitamins, and minerals.[5]

Breeding Hyphessobrycon heterorhabdus in captivity involves creating conditions that mimic their natural habitat, particularly the rainy season of the Amazon Basin. A dedicated breeding tank with soft, acidic water (pH 6.0 to 6.5), a temperature of around 24°C (75°F), dim lighting, and fine-leaved plants or spawning mops can encourage spawning.[6] Flag Tetras, being egg scatterers without parental instincts, may consume their eggs, necessitating the removal of adults post-spawning or the use of a mesh bottom or marbles to protect the eggs. The eggs usually hatch within 24 to 36 hours, with fry initially fed on infusoria or liquid fry food until they can eat micro worms or baby brine shrimp. Attention to water quality and a gradual introduction to the adult diet are critical for the fry's growth and health. This process not only enables the conservation of the species but also allows aquarists to observe the lifecycle of these vibrant fish.

Flag Tetra, like many aquarium fish, are susceptible to a range of common diseases, particularly when kept in suboptimal water conditions or overcrowded tanks. One prevalent condition is Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, commonly known as ""Ich"" or white spot disease, characterized by white, salt-like spots on the fish's body and gills, often leading to increased irritability and rubbing against tank surfaces. Another common ailment is fin rot, a bacterial infection that causes the edges of the fins to appear frayed or disintegrated, often resulting from poor water quality or stress.[5]

蓝灯鱼,Boehlkea fredcochui,弗氏贝基脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

Boehlkea fredcochui, also known as the Cochu's blue tetra is a species of characin. Its natural range is in the Amazon Basin. It is commonly kept as an aquarium fish.[1][2]

The fish is named in honor of tropical fish importer Ferdinand (Fred) Cochu of the Paramount Aquarium, who introduced this species to the aquarium hobby around 1956.[3]

As for other schooling characins, the cochu's blue tetra should always be kept in groups of at least six. A very active fish, it requires open areas in which to swim and is best kept in aquariums 90 cm (35 in) or larger. Aggression is generally limited to conspecifics in appropriate setups, but they may harass other fish in too small a tank, or without enough other tetras.

Spawning may occur in home setups, with the eggs being scattered over fine leafed plants. Soft, acidic water is required for hatching to occur. Males may be differentiated from females by their slimmer, more streamlined form and more intense colouration.

幻影灯,Hyphessobrycon eques,马鲃脂鲤,脂鲤科,"


The serpae tetra (Hyphessobrycon eques), also known as the red minor tetra, jewel tetra or callistus tetra,[3] is a species of tetra, a tropical freshwater fish of the characin family (family Characidae) of order Characiformes.  It is native to the Amazon River drainage in Brazil, Peru, Paraguay, Bolivia and northern Argentina. The fish can be found in slow moving or still backwater including, ponds, small lakes, and streams. In the wild, it forms aggregations around vegetation and tree roots, and thrives when the water temperature is 22–27 °C (72–81 °F).

Serpae tetra can grow to be 5 cm (2.0 in). They have very distinctive coloring with a red body and a black spot near their gills. It is an omnivore and will feed on flake and blood worms.

Serpae tetras prefer water temperatures ranging from 72–79 °F (22–26 °C). They will generally do better and show off their best colors in soft, neutral to slightly acidic water. As with any other schooling fish, they thrive in large groups and should be kept in schools of at least six fish. The tank should be well-planted, providing shelter and hiding spots.

Common to these fish is a 'sputtering' or 'twitching' style of swimming, in which their movements seem more spastic as opposed to other fish.  Instead of swimming smoothly or for long distances at a time, Serpae Tetras move in relatively short spurts, unless stressed.  This is their normal behavior and by itself need not alarm aquarists.

If any aggression is seen in the fish, it is usually among conspecifics, especially if they are kept in large groups where they can establish a pecking order (a behavior similar to Puntius tetrazona). 

Breeding, as with most other tetras, can be difficult due to the few obvious differences between the genders. However, males are usually slimmer and smaller than females. Also, a visible difference in the shape of the swim bladder can be seen above and behind the silverish abdominal cavity. To breed these fish, they should be given a small, dedicated breeding tank planted with thick bunches of fine-leaved plants such as Myriophyllum on which they can lay eggs. Filtering through peat moss can also be helpful. The eggs hatch in about 2 days.

The average lifespan for a serpae tetra is about seven years.

黑影灯,Hyphessobrycon megalopterus,大鳍鲃脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

Megalomphodus megalopterus
Megalamphodus rogoaguae

The black phantom tetra (Hyphessobrycon megalopterus), or simply phantom tetra, is a small freshwater fish of the characin family (Characidae) of order Characiformes.[2] It is native to the upper Paraguay basin and upper Madeira basin (including Guaporé, Mamore and Beni) in Brazil and Bolivia.[3] It is commonly seen in the aquarium trade.[3]

This fish is of roughly tetragonal shape, light grey in coloring, with a black patch, surrounded by iridescent silver edging, posterior of the gills on each side. The male's fins are black, as is the female's dorsal fin; the female's pelvic, anal, and 
adipose fins are reddish in color. A long-finned variety, apparently developed by captive breeders, is sometimes sold in the aquarium trade (the male has elongated dorsal and anal fins even in the wild form). The black phantom tetra reaches a maximum standard length of 3.6 cm (1.4 in).[2]

The male black phantom tetras have longer fins than the females and when in breeding condition, the females become plumper, but the biggest difference is in their color. The males have no red, while the smaller fins of the female both on the top and underneath them are red. The adipose fin, on the top of the body behind the larger dorsal fin, is much more noticeable in the females than the males, because in females it is red while in the males it is grey. The female's dorsal fin has a more intense black than the male's. When the fish are in breeding condition, the colors of both sexes become more distinct, with the male showing its black fins more obviously.

The black phantom tetra's natural diet consist of small crustaceans, insects, and worms.[2]

H. megalopterus is one of the more popular tetras sold in the aquarium trade. While it is not particularly colorful, it makes up for this by its display behavior: the males are territorial and defend their space against their neighbors by presenting themselves in profile with the dorsal and anal fins fully extended, and the dark color intensified, making the edging of the body patch stand out prominently. Sometimes they exchange blows which can tear the fins, but this damage heals quickly. Unlike other tetras who prefer to live in large shoals, they will also do fine when kept in a group of four or five individuals, making them suitable for smaller aquaria. They still need enough space for the males to stake territories and present themselves to best effort, however.

The fish should be well conditioned to induce spawning. When possible, live foods are included in the conditioning period. Frozen foods like bloodworms are also used as conditioning food.

The Black phantom tetra is an egg-scattering species.[4] To stimulate breeding, pH is lowered to about 5.5-6, the general hardness of the water is also reduced below four degrees. The breeding tank should have plants, both rooted and floating, and low light.

A female black phantom tetra will produce about 300 eggs. These fish will eat their own eggs and fry, so the parents are usually removed after spawning.[4]

The fry become free-swimming after five days.[4] They are fed infusoria (protozoa) at first. Commercial fry foods of suitable sizes can be used but at all stages the young fish benefit from live food of the right size.

红裙鱼,Hyphessobrycon flammeus,火焰鲃脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

The flame tetra (Hyphessobrycon flammeus), also known as the red tetra or Rio tetra, is a small freshwater fish of the characin family Characidae. This tetra was first introduced as aquarium fish in 1920 by C. Bruening, Hamburg, Germany, and  formally described in 1924 by Dr. George S. Myers.[2][3] Today large numbers are bred in captivity and it is common in the aquarium trade,[4] but the remaining wild population in Southeast Brazil is highly threatened.[5][6]

Cuba produced a postal stamp with an image of H. flammeus in 1978.[7]

The flame tetra reaches about 2.5 cm (1 in) in standard length.[5][6][8] The rear half of the body is flame red while the area in front of the dorsal fin is silver crossed by two dark vertical bars. All the fins are red except for the pectoral fins, which are colourless. The tip of the anal fin on the male is black, while on the female the fins have less red colouration but darker tips of the pectoral fins.

The flame tetra is native to Southeast Brazil, where it occurs in coastal parts of Rio de Janeiro (Guanabara bay region, and Paraíba do Sul and Guandu River basins) and São Paulo (upper Tietê River basin).[5][6] It lives in rivers and streams, generally preferring shallow (less than 0.5 m or 1.6 ft deep), slow-flowing sections with vegetation and a water temperature from 22 to 28 °C (72–82 °F).[5]

The species has declined drastically, mainly because of habitat loss, pollution and introduced species (especially tilapia and black bass).[5][6] Although sometimes reported as extinct in the wild,[8] wild populations survive.[5][6] In its small remaining distribution, it is common in the Tietê River basin (which possibly is not natural, but introduced) and rare elsewhere.[5] The last confirmed record from Rio de Janeiro is from 1992.[6] The species is listed as endangered in the Brazilian national red list.[9]

Today large numbers are bred in captivity and it is common in the aquarium trade.[4][6] This includes some selectively-bred forms (such as golden, orange and albino) that differ from the original wild form.[6]

H. flammeus is a peaceful schooling fish, and will generally do well in groups.  H. flammeus has an omnivorous diet.[8]  The species will breed in captivity.[8]

三带鱼,Hyphessobrycon amapaensis,亚马鲃脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

Hyphessobrycon amapaensis, sometimes more commonly known as the red line tetra, the Amapá tetra, or scarlet tetra, is a species of fish endemic to Brazil.

The red line tetra is similar in shape to the Buenos Aires tetra. It is a silvery fish with a red line running down the body, hence the name. Below the red line is a small yellow line and an even smaller black one. They grow to about 2.5 to 3 cm (0.98 to 1.18 in).[2]

The species is only known from its type locality, a small savanna creek in the drainage of the Rio Preto, where it occurs over sand and gravel bottoms.[3][2]

The red line tetra is a peaceful community fish. They are best kept in groups of 6 to 8. A heavily planted tank is recommended. The temperature required is 23 to 28 °C (73 to 82 °F). They are an egg scattering fish that does not care for its young.[2]

喷火灯,Hyphessobrycon amandae,爱鲃脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

The ember tetra (Hyphessobrycon amandae) is a freshwater fish of the characin family (family Characidae) of
order Characiformes. It is native to the Araguaia River basin of Brazil and was discovered in 1987 and named in honor of the fish explorer Heiko Bleher's mother (Amanda Bleher).[2]

This species is of typical tetra shape but grows to a maximum overall length of approximately 2 cm (0.8 in) to 3 cm (1.2 in); Most exhibit striking orange and reddish coloration with mild translucency near the pelvic fin. The eye frequently mirrors the color of the fish and is outlined in black.

The fish's natural diet consist of small invertebrates and plants.

Although somewhat hard to find in fish stores, H. amandae is commonly kept as an aquarium fish by hobbyists.

The minimum tank size requirement for the Ember tetras is at least 10 gallons with few live aquarium plants.[citation needed] Ember tetras should be kept in acidic water with a pH near 6.6, and although their native habitat has very soft water they have adapted quite well to a wide range of hardness (5–17 dGH). The recommended temperature range is between 23–29 °C (73–84 °F).

Ideally their tank should contain live plants, a darker substrate, and open water for swimming. Ember tetras should be kept in groups of at least 6, though recommended number is 9–10, in order to promote schooling. They appreciate a heavily planted aquarium, ideally with a small area shaded from direct light and will spend a lot of time swimming through planted areas, which also offer some protection for their fry.

Ember tetras will school with other tetras, such as the neon tetra, but may become stressed by the presence of significantly larger fish.

These fish swim at the middle level of the aquarium, and they don't feed from the bottom of the tank. Therefore, it is recommended that they are kept with other bottom dwelling fish (such as pygmy corydoras) so that leftover food is then eaten up off the substrate and not left to waste.

Ember tetras can be fed a variety of foods, including flake, frozen, and freeze dried food. Small live foods like worms and brine shrimp are also recommended as they bring out the fish's colors.

In a well maintained heavily planted aquarium, Ember tetras have been known to live ten years or more.

Hyphessobrycon sweglesi is a species of tetra that lives in the Orinoco River drainage basin in South America.[2] The species' scientific name used to be Megalamphodus sweglisi and the species' common name is red phantom tetra.[3]  It grows up to 4 cm (1.6 in).[4]

The fish has a round black spot behind the gill-plate, a black band on the dorsal fin that is bordered above and below by creamy-white. The other fins are red same as the upper rim of the eye.[5] The species' appearance is very similar to Hyphessobrycon megalopterus (black phantom tetra). 

Aquarists keep this fish in water ranging from 20 to 23 °C (68 to 73 °F) that is soft (50-100mg/L) and acidic (pH 6.5).[4]  The H. sweglesi is reported to be very sensitive to water chemistry, which affects the fish's coloration.[4]  Frequent water changes are advised for it to thrive and to induce it to breed.[4]

The fish eats worms, small insects, and crustaceans.[2] In captivity, aquarists feed it prepared foods and small live foods.[4]

The species can lay up to 400 eggs that can hatch in a day. The eggs are susceptible to fungus. 

Aquarists put dark substrate in the spawning tank to protect the eggs from light.[4]

玫瑰扯旗,Hyphessobrycon rosaceus,玫瑰鲃脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

The rosy tetra (Hyphessobrycon rosaceus) is a small species of characin from the South American countries of Guyana and Suriname.[1] It is popular in the aquarium trade.

The rosy tetra has a light pink-white body with red fins, except the dorsal fin which can be black or white, and the caudal fin which is pink-white with two elliptical red spots on it. It has a faint black line from the top of its eyeball through the pupil, to the bottom of the eyeball. Like many other tetras, the males have longer dorsal fins than the females.[citation needed]

In the wild, the rosy tetra lives in the Essequibo, Corantijn and Suriname River basins in South America.[2]

The rosy tetra is an egg scattering school spawning fish in the wild. 100 eggs can be laid by one female, usually in the early morning, and over fine leaved plants.[citation needed]

Hemibrycon ocelliferTetragonopterus ocellifer

Hemigrammus ocellifer is a South American freshwater fish, also known by the Common names of beacon fish, beacon tetra, head-and-tail light tetra and head-and-taillight tetra.[3][4]  It is found in the rivers of Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and the Amazon Basin of Brazil and Peru.

Most specimens offered for sale in the aquatics trade are tank-raised.

It has a maximum size of 5 centimetres (2.0 in); the sexes are distinguished by mature females being fuller bodied.

Captive-raised specimens will acclimatise to a range of water conditions: pH should be 6-8; dH up to 18°; and temperature 72 to 79 °F (22 to 26 °C).

A suitable species for planted community aquariums, beacon tetras should be kept in shoals of six or more and provided with floating plants to diffuse any bright lighting. Hiding places and open swimming areas should be available and consideration is given to the colors of this fish showing best when they are housed in tanks with a dark substrate and background.

Beacon tetras will accept flake, micropellets, and frozen foods such as mosquito larvae, brine shrimp and daphnia.

An egg-laying species, Hemigrammus ocellifer is relatively easy to breed. A separate small planted breeding aquarium should be set up with soft, slightly acidic water, and the temperature set at the high end of their range. When morning sunlight hits the tank, spawning should commence, and between 200 and 1000 eggs can be laid. The parents should be removed immediately after spawning ceases, and the eggs will hatch in 24 hours.

美丽灯,Hemigrammus pulcher,丽半线脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

Hemigrammus pulcher is a semi-popular aquarium species, also known as the pretty tetra, garnet tetra or black wedge tetra.[1] In the wild, the species is found near Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon, and probably also in Brazil and Colombia.[1]

The H. pulcher has a pale-lemon background color with a black area on the flanks, up to the caudal penduncle.[2]  Under subdued lighting, the H. pulcher's body appears iridescent.[2]  It grows up to 4 cm (1.6 in).[2]

Males can be distinguished from females through the shape of the swim bladder, which can be seen through the fish's semi-transparent body.[2]  In males, the swim bladder is pointed, while in females, the swim bladder is rounded.[2]

Aquarists keep this fish in water with temperatures ranging from 23 to 27 °C (73 to 81 °F) that is soft (50–100 mg/L) and acidic (pH 6.0).[2]  The fish is reported to be peaceful and social.[2]

Aquarists recommend that it be fed prepared foods and small live foods.[2]

Breeding is difficult, as parents must be prevented from eating their own eggs. Eggs usually hatch within 20–24 hours.

The H. pulcher does best in groups of 6 or more.

红灯管,Hemigrammus erythrozonus,红带半线脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

Hemigrammus erythrozonus, commonly known as the glowlight tetra, is a small tropical fish from the Essequibo River, Guyana, South America. It is silver in colour and a bright iridescent orange to red stripe extends from the snout to the base of its tail, the front of the dorsal fin being the same color as the stripe. Other fins are silver to transparent. The glowlight tetra is a peaceful, shoaling fish. It is larger than the neon tetra, and its peaceful disposition makes it an ideal, and popular, community tank fish. It should be kept with similar sized, non-aggressive species. Hemigrammus gracilis is a senior synonym. The red-line rasbora (Rasbora pauciperforata) of Malaysia and Indonesia has markings and coloring very similar to H. erythrozonus, but is a member of family Cyprinidae, not a close relative.

H. erythrozonus is a medium-sized tetra growing to 4 to 5 cm (1.6 to 2.0 in), notably larger than both neon and cardinal tetras. It has a life span of two to four years when kept in good conditions.

In the wild, the fish eats aquatic insect larvae.[2]

H. erythrozonus is readily available and usually inexpensive.[citation needed] Golden and albino varieties are also sold.[citation needed] It is best seen in the freshwater aquarium when kept in subdued lighting with a dark substrate.[3]

The water should be soft to slightly hard, d°GH of 6° to 15°, with a slightly acidic pH of 6.8, in the range 6.0 – 7.5. It prefers a temperature of 25 °C (77 °F) in the range 22–28 °C (72–82 °F).   
The hardiness of this fish allows it easily to adapt to harder water, though soft water is essential for captive breeding.

H. erythrozonus is an omnivore and in the aquarium eats small live, frozen and dry foods and flake foods. The feeding of vegetable matter is suggested to vary the diet.

Like all tetras, H. erythrozonus is happiest, most active, and most aesthetically pleasing when in a shoal. A minimum aquarium length of 60 cm (2 ft) will make them more comfortable when swimming. They prefer a well planted tank for hiding, but with some open water for free swimming. They should be a group of at least four with eight or more to make them feel secure. They tend to swim in tighter groups when a potential predator is present and swim freely when comfortable. They are often bought by aquarium owners to play a 'second fiddle' role to the neon tetra. Although they generally shoal separately from neon and cardinal tetras, they will sometimes shoal alongside the latter, making an arresting spectacle.

Like most tetras, females are larger and more fat bodied than the more slender male. It may be hard to tell male from female until the fish are fully mature and females fill with eggs.

H. erythrozonus breeds similarly to most egg-scattering small fish. It been bred in captivity with a moderate level of difficulty.

Breeding tank set-up: A small 40l all-glass tank with soft water (hardness up to 8°dGH and carbonate hardness not higher than 2°dCH). Water temperature should be kept between 26 and 28 °C (79 and 82 °F). Adding peat to the tank or filter will soften water and make it slightly acidic. The tank should have dim or no lighting. Spawning is over fine-leaved plants. Java moss (Taxiphyllum barbieri) or Fontinalis are suggested but not mandatory, or a spawning mop made of woolen thread. Other commonly used plants include water wisteria and hornworts, as well as fox/coons tail. 1 cm glass beads or a spawning grate will help at the bottom to protect eggs from being eaten by adults, though they will have to spawn through the plants first, as the fine leaves act as a trigger. If spawned without fine leaved plants, the majority of eggs will result unfertilized.

Parents' conditioning: Feed the pair kept separately with a variety of live foods, frozen food or dry food for a few weeks. When the female is well rounded transfer the pair to the breeding tank in the late afternoon hours. The spawning will occur in the following morning or the next day; if no spawning behavior is shown after three days, conditioning of the pair should be restarted.

Spawning behavior: The male will swim around in a quick manner locking his fins when near the female. During the spawning act both fish roll over, when the female is in the upside down position she ejects the eggs while the male fertilises them. Usually 120-150 eggs are dropped on plants and on to the bottom. When the pair is done, they will start grazing for the eggs and should be removed.

Raising the fry: The eggs are light sensitive, so the breeding tank should be as dark as possible. Some believe light contributes greatly to the eggs succumbing to fungal infections, though this may have more to do with cleanliness of tank and water conditions. Methylene blue may be added to the water column to prevent fungi as well. The fry will hatch in 20 to 25 hours, looking like small slivers of glass. Fry can be fed with infusoria, paramecium culture, crushed flakes, and rotifers after they have used all the yolk sack. On the fourth day a very small portion of newly hatched brine shrimp should be introduced. The young consume relatively large live foods such as nauplii of brine shrimp. Later microworms can be added to the diet.

Care of the breeding tank: Bottom sediment should always be removed and regular water changes done during the rearing period in order to avoid an accumulation of ammonium and nitrates which can be toxic to the fry. Although large quantities of fry will incubate in waters of low hardness, most of the fry may soon contract non-infectious, constitutional dropsy, and die within a short time. Those which survive will grow well. By the twelfth day, they will show signs of a silver coloring. At three weeks of age, the fry will start showing their characteristic orange line and will be a size of about 1 cm (1⁄2 in). By two months they will be about 2 cm (3⁄4 in).

Hemigrammus rhodostomus

The rummy-nose tetra (Petitella rhodostoma) is a species of tropical freshwater characin fish originating in South America, popular among fishkeepers as a tropical aquarium fish.[2] One of many small tetras belonging to the same genus, it is on average 5 cm (2 in) long when fully grown.[3] The fish is one of several very similar species including Petitella bleheri, and Petitella georgiae, and it is possible that more recently collected specimens available in the aquarium trade are members of one or other of these similar species.[4] The common name applied to most of these fishes is ""rummy-nose tetra"", though other common names are in circulation (such as ""firehead tetra"" for P. bleheri, and “false rummy nose tetra” for P. georgiae according to FishBase, and Fishkeeping World).[5][6]

The rummy-nose tetra is fusiform in shape, whose basal body colour is a translucent silvery colour suffused in some specimens with a greenish tint: iridescent green scales are frequently seen adorning the fish at the point where the fontanel meets the body. The fins are hyaline, with the exception of the caudal fin. This fin being adorned with black and white horizontal stripes, variable in number, but usually comprising one central black stripe in the central portion of the tail fin, with two horizontal black stripes upon each caudal fin lobe, the spaces between the stripes being white, the total count of black stripes being five, or occasionally three; however, whether these features are reliable determinants of species identity has yet to be fully ascertained.[7] The head is a deep red colour, iridescent in lustre, with the red continuing into the iris of the eye, and some red colouration extends beyond the operculum into the anterior-most section of the body proper.[4]

Male and female individuals exhibit no obvious visual differences, other than increased fullness of the body outline in ripe females.[8]

The three different species of fish known as rummy-nose tetras have the following distributions:

All three species of rummy-nose tetra inhabit river stretches whose water chemistry is mineral-deficient (soft), acidic, and frequently tainted with humic acid decay products from leaf litter upon the river substrates (known as 'blackwaters' because of their appearance). Aquatic plants are sometimes present in these stretches of water, though the upper reaches of the Rio Negro are less densely populated with aquatic flora than the other rivers due to shading from the rainforest canopy. The fishes preferentially inhabit the middle and mid-lower water regions.[9] The fish prefer darker waters as evidence of the eggs and fry being light sensitive.[10]

The Rummy-nose tetra is a schooling fish which means that the members of each school travel in groups that vary about 6 at minimum to sometimes more than 32 fish. Rummy-nose tetras are also very good at navigating in an environment that is too ""noisy"" for other fish. In a study about the schooling tendencies, Puckett, Pokhrel, and Giannini wrote that the Tetras were able to outperform another schooling species of fish called ""golden shiners"". (Notemigonus crysoleucas). Rummy-nose tetras when schooling tend to rely more on what the individual organism perceives rather than what the group behavior is, which differs from golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas), another type of schooling fish. This can be attributed to the fact that Petitella bleheri is more attuned to the light gradients that are present in its environment. Rummy-nose tetra while being able to perceive their environment better individually rather than in a group still has the ability to sense what the distance is between them and the nears member of the school, thus decreasing the risk of predation.[11] Interestingly, although each species is from different parts of South America, when introduced to either of the other two species, all species will shoal together.[10]

The details of aquarium maintenance for all three species are more or less identical: the rummy-nose tetra is a schooling fish, which exhibits tight schooling behaviour both in the wild and in the aquarium. Consequently, these fishes should be maintained in groups of no fewer than six individuals, with larger numbers being preferable where space permits-these tetras preferring about a 25 gallon/80 litre aquarium.[6] All three species are lovers of warm aquarium water, the temperature range for maintenance being 24 to 31 °C (75 to 88 °F), with the fishes sometimes requiring temperatures as high as 33 °C (91 °F) for breeding. Consequently, compatibility of these fishes with cooler water fishes is contra-indicated: for example, panda corydoras would be a bad choice of companion as these fishes prefer lower temperatures, and there is little overlap in the temperature ranges of the two species. Many fish can be kept with rummy-nose tetras, some including smaller gourami, other tetras, barbs, danios, Australian rainbows, and various catfish, such as Ancistrus. The rummy-nose tetra cannot be kept with other popular ornamental fishes, such as African cichlids, as they require very different water parameters.[12]

The water chemistry preferred by these fishes, as might be inferred readily from that of the wild habitat, is soft, acidic water (hardness no higher than 6° dH and pH around 6.4–7.0 is preferred). However, for maintenance purposes the pH of the aquarium water can range from 5.6 to 7.4. However, if captive reproduction is to be attempted, the rummy-nose tetra needs soft, acidic water. A planted aquarium is welcomed by these fishes, particularly if the plants include fine-leaved species such as Cabomba and Myriophyllum.

Feeding presents relatively few problems, as the fishes will eagerly devour a range of prepared as well as live fish foods. However, if they have a flake or pellet-based diet, a treat once or twice a week is recommended to give the diet variety.[6][13] In common with numerous other tetras, these fishes are particularly fond of live bloodworms (these are the aquatic larvae of a midge belonging to the genus Chironomus) and will also devour live Daphnia avidly. Unlike those tetra species which adapt to surface feeding in the aquarium, rummy-nose tetras are not considered likely to add live mosquito larvae to their diet in the aquarium, though instances where these fishes discover and enjoy this food are possible: usually, rummy-nose tetras prefer to take their foods in the middle and lower regions of the aquarium.

Lifespan for the rummy-nose tetra in the aquarium is usually 5 to 6 years with careful maintenance. Exceptional specimens can live for more than 8 years.

The fish is interesting in that it can act as a ""mine canary"" in an aquarium, alerting the aquarist to potential pollution problems in an aquarium. When levels of certain metabolic wastes (ammonia, nitrites and nitrates) exceed critical levels, the intense ruby-red colour of the fish's facial area becomes pale. The fishes also become pale in appearance immediately after the disturbance that takes place in the aquarium following a water change, but in this instance, once clean water has been supplied, the intense deep red colour returns. Persistent paleness of the head is to be taken as a sign that water chemistry parameters in the maintenance aquarium are in need of adjustment, and that pollutant levels are becoming dangerous for the inhabitants.

Rummy-nose tetras present serious challenges even to experienced aquarists from the standpoint of breeding, primarily due to two factors: the likelihood of sterility ensuing if the prospective parents are maintained in water with too high a level of dissolved calcium ions, and the slow growth rate of the fry. An additional problem is that gender differentiation is difficult by visual inspection alone, making pair selection partly a matter of luck unless an obviously gravid female is available for selection. Again, identical remarks apply to all three species listed above.

The breeding aquarium for the rummy-nose tetra, in addition, needs to be sterilised prior to use, as the fish produces eggs that are notoriously sensitive to bacterial and fungal infection. Use of an antifungal agent is strongly advised once spawning is completed in order to prevent various fungi from attacking the eggs.

Needless to say, given the above remarks about likely sterility if the fishes are maintained in water whose chemical parameters are incorrect, prospective parents must be maintained in soft, acidic water throughout their lives if they are to remain capable of reproduction. Failure to do so will destroy any chances of success from the very start. Furthermore, it is highly advisable to filter the water of the breeding aquarium over peat, or alternatively use one of the commercially available 'Blackwater Tonic' additives to provide the necessary chemical environment conducive to reproduction. Parent fishes should, in addition, be conditioned heavily with copious live foods to bring them into prime breeding condition.

Though the fishes prefer to spawn among fine leaved plants, one problem that the aquarist faces in this regard is that the majority of fine leaved plants available in the aquarium prefer high light levels (Cabomba is a particular case in point) while the rummy-nose tetra prefers to spawn under subdued lighting conditions. Workarounds for this include the use of Java moss (a plant that thrives even in very low light levels, and is an ideal spawning medium for many fishes) or the use of synthetic alternatives (""spawning mops"" made of nylon are typically deployed where a suitable natural plant is unavailable).

The parents should be introduced to the breeding aquarium up to 7 days before spawning, fed heavily with live foods, and kept under subdued lighting. In addition, the parents tend to prefer to spawn under quiet conditions, and thus the aquarium should be sited away from areas of busy human traffic. The temperature should be slowly raised to 32 °C (90 °F), and sometimes 33 °C (91 °F) may be needed depending upon the individual specimens. Spawning is difficult to observe, taking place as it does under subdued lighting, and while chase sequences followed by the adoption of a side-by-side position by the parents amid the provided spawning media may be taken as indication that spawning is indeed taking place, this is by no means certain. The judicious use of a low-power flashlight to observe spawning may be helpful in determining if eggs are actually being produced.

The species is not noted as a particularly egregious egg eater (unlike, for example, the lemon tetra) but it is still advisable to remove the parents once spawning is completed. At this stage, antifungal agents to protect the eggs should be added, and indeed are vital in the case of this difficult, sensitive species.

Once spawning is completed, it is advisable to keep the aquarium under dim lighting conditions until the eggs have hatched and the fry are free-swimming. While rummy-nose tetras do not need their eggs to be kept in total darkness as is the case for neon and cardinal tetras, the eggs are known to exhibit some degree of photosensitivity, and subdued lighting is highly advisable during egg development in the breeding aquarium.

Fertile rummy-nose tetra eggs take approximately 72 to 96 hours to hatch at 32 °C (90 °F). The fry spend a further 24 to 48 hours absorbing the yolk sac, whereupon they become free-swimming. At this stage, the fry should be fed with infusoria or a special egglayer fry food, and frequent partial water changes (around 10% of the aquarium volume every 24 to 48 hours) initiated.

Having overcome the challenge of persuading the fishes to spawn, the aquarist soon discovers that the rummy-nose tetra presents another hurdle to successful captive reproduction—the fry are among the slowest growing of all characins, and indeed among the slowest-growing of all popular aquarium fishes. Infusoria and other similar foods are required for the fry for a minimum of three weeks, and it is not unknown for the fishes to take as long as twelve weeks to migrate to larger foods, growth rates being particularly sensitive to temperature. Success at raising fry to a size where they are capable of taking larger food morsels is much more likely to be achieved if the fry are kept at temperatures above 30 °C for the first 3 months of life: even then, attrition rates due to the appearance of diseases among the fishes (most frequently bacterial infections) can be severe.

It can take as long as 6 months to raise fry to juvenile sizes where they are capable of eating live daphnia on a regular basis. During this time, they are likely to be sensitive to sudden changes in water chemistry, and managing pollutants in the fry aquarium is made all the more difficult by the need to maintain low mineral content in the aquarium water during development in order to prevent sterility affecting the fishes—the buffering capacity of the aquarium is likely to be low as a result of the low concentration of bicarbonate ions that is needed in addition to the low concentration of calcium ions. Taking all of these factors into account, the fish is a major breeding challenge for the aquarist, and success may depend at least partly upon luck.

The gold tetra, or Rodway's tetra[1] (Hemigrammus rodwayi) is a species of small freshwater fish in the family Characidae native to lowland South America,[2] where they are abundant in coastal floodplains.[3] Their name comes from a powdery golden tint on their body that is thought to be caused by internal parasites.[4] Gold tetras are peaceful, hardy, schooling community fish.[5] Gold tetras have been successfully bred in captivity.[6]

The patronym was given by Marion Durban Ellis in honor of James Rodway (1848-1926), a renowned naturalist of British Guiana, who aided Carl Eigenmann’s collecting trips in South America.[7][8][9][10][11]

Hyphessobrycon ulreyi Boulenger, 1895

Hemigrammus ulreyi, commonly known as Ulrey's tetra, is a Paraguayan tropical aquarium fish from the family Characidae named in honor of the biologist Albert B. Ulrey. It was originally named Tetragonopterus ulreyi in 1895.[2]

This aquarium fish suitable for a community aquarium can reach 5 cm (2.0 in) in length and does well at temperatures of 21 to 29 °C (70 to 84 °F).[3]

The breeding size is 4 cm (1.6 in). Dr. Herbert R. Axelrod, editor of Tropical Fish Hobbyist Magazine, and Dr. Leonard P. Schultz, retired curator of fishes at the Smithsonian Institution, wrote that the breeding of this species is a problem, since the species is nearly identical to Hyphessobrycon heterorhabdus and is difficult to spawn.[3]

The bleeding heart tetra (Hyphessobrycon erythrostigma) is a freshwater tropical fish native to the Upper Amazon River basin.[2][3] It grows to the size of 2.5 in (64 mm) and lives for around five years.

The female is more full bodied and the male has a larger dorsal fin, whereas the male is distinguished by longer extended dorsal and anal fins. The dorsal fin is elongated into a sickle shape that arches to the length of the tail base. The female has a shorter rounded fin.

This egg-laying fish has been bred successfully, with difficulty, in captivity.[2]

The dorsal fin and anal fin of the males can become long and flowing.[2] Both sexes have the eye-catching blood-red spot in the pectoral area. Both also have the black and white patch on the dorsal fin.

A group of 6 fishes will feel comfortable in a 15-gallon tank, but a bigger tank (preferably 30 gallons) and more fishes are recommended.

According to the Encyclopedia of Aquarium and Pond Fish, it prefers water of 23–28 °C (73–82 °F) that is soft (50–100 mg/L) and acidic (pH 5.6-6.9), and a diet of prepared foods and small live foods.[2]  It is recommended that peat be added to the filter to help keep the water conditions suitable for it.[2]

银屏灯,Moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae,桑氏直线脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

The redeye tetra (Moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae), is a species of tetra from the São Francisco, upper Paraná, Paraguay and Uruguay river basins in eastern and central South America.[2][3] This freshwater fish is commonly kept in aquariums and bred in large numbers at commercial facilities in Eastern Europe and Asia.[4] The redeye tetra is one of the more popular aquarium fish due to their schooling capability.

It can grow up to 7 cm (2.8 in) in length,[4] and live for approximately 5 years.[3]  The red-eye tetra has a bright silver body accented by a white-edged black basal half of the tail and a thin red circle around its eye. It is part of a group that consists of three similar species, the two others being M. forestii (upper Paraguay and upper Paraná basins) and M. oligolepis (Amazon and Paraguay basins, and the Guianas).[5]

Yellow-banded tetra is another common name for the M. sanctaefilomenae. The fish has a yellow band on its caudal peduncle, which differentiates it from the glass tetra.[6]

Because of the redeye tetra's hardiness and ease of care, it is considered by aquarists to be an excellent beginner fish. It is readily available, peaceful, and is suitable for most community aquariums,[4] although it is quite active and may disturb slower, more timid species.

The redeye tetra is a schooling fish.[6] For this reason aquarists often keep it in groups of six or more.[2] Although generally peaceful, some redeye tetras have been known to be fin nippers on rare occasions, even when kept in groups. If kept alone it is more likely to nip the fins of other fish.[7] A fish tank with volume of about 110 litres (29 US G.) is commonly used.

The species is frequently kept at temperatures of 23–28 °C (73–82 °F) in hard water (100–150 mg/L) with neutral pH (7.0), in a tank with plants around the sides and to the rear and a clear area in the front.[6] Redeyes are reported to be adaptable to a range of water conditions.[6]

In the wild the redeye tetra feeds on worms, insects, crustaceans and plant matter.[2] In the aquarium, redeye tetras generally eat all kinds of live, fresh, and flake foods. It can be fed both prepared foods and live foods in captivity.[6]

Females are larger and have a more rounded abdomen than the males.[4] When attempting to breed them, a separate breeding tank with slightly acidic, very soft water (4 dGH or below) is often used,[4] with the tank densely planted.[6] The redeye tetra is free spawning, but will also lay eggs among the roots of floating plants.[4]

Once spawning has occurred, the mating pair are typically removed, as they will consume the eggs and hatchling fry.[4] The eggs typically hatch one day after they are laid. Aquarists initially feed the fry with infusoria, rotifers, or commercially prepared fry foods, then freshly hatched brine shrimp, and eventually finely crushed flake foods.[4]

钻石灯,Moenkhausia pittieri,闪光直线脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

The diamond tetra (Moenkhausia pittieri) is a small freshwater fish of the characin family (family Characidae) of order Characiformes. It is found in and around Lake Valencia in Venezuela, South America.

This species exhibits clear sexual dimorphism, with males having much longer dorsal fins than the females. Males also tend to be more brightly coloured, but both sexes are attractive fish and have become popular with aquarists. The dorsal and anal fins are purple and the body is silver. The eye is marked with red above the pupil, and there is a dark band running along the midline of the body. Their common name comes from the bright, iridescent scales along the flanks. This species very much resemble Metynnis and Myleus species.

Although the patronym was not identified, it is probably in honor of Swiss-born geographer-botanist Henri François Pittier (1857–1950), who lived in Venezuela and collected some specimens for Eigenmann.[1]

Diamond tetras are endemic to the northern area of Venezuela. They hail originally from the waters of Lake Valencia, located between the states Carabobo and Aragua, and its tributaries. They inhabit slow moving streams with abundant vegetation and leaf litter. These fish are threatened by urban growth, which destroys and pollutes their habitat. The species has seemingly disappeared completely from Lake Valencia, where they were collected initially. In 2009 the Venezuelan underwater photographer Ivan Mikolji was able to find and photograph a population of this fish in a stream nearby Lake Valencia.[2]

The diamond tetra is an omnivore. In the wild they eat whatever they can forage, with a preference for small animal food items, especially mosquito larvae.
In a home aquarium they eat most standard fish foods, such as flakes and pellets. They benefit from a variety of food such as live daphnia or frozen bloodworms.

A pair or group of diamond tetras will spawn in an aquarium with a shaded area, which can be created by including fine-leaved plants such as Java moss or a spawning mop. The fish should be well conditioned beforehand with nutritious food, preferably small live foods.

Soft acidic water in the pH range of 5.5–6.5 is preferred, and a temperature of around 26–29 °C (79–84 °F) is suitable.

The fish usually spawn in the early morning. If not removed from the tank, the adults will eat their eggs. It is recommended to remove them after spawning. The eggs normally hatch within 36 hours and the fry are usually free swimming in around 4 days.

Diamond tetra fry grow quickly. They can feed on pre-made fry foods, but suitably sized live foods will help at all stages of development.

The bloodfin tetra (Aphyocharax anisitsi) is a species of characin from the Paraná River basin in South America.[2] The bloodfin is a relatively large tetra, growing to 5.5 cm.[3] Its notable feature (as the name suggests) is the blood-red colouration of the tail, dorsal, anal and adipose fin, while the body is silver in color.

Bloodfin tetras are extremely hardy, making them popular with novice fish keepers.

Bloodfin tetras are typically kept in schools of five or more. They swim mainly in the upper and middle water layers and are highly sociable fishes, mixing well with other types of tetras and tropical fish in general, so are often kept (like many other tetras) in a community tank. However, they will tend to nip at the fins of fish with long, wavy fins, such as angelfish or guppies. Bloodfin tetras have also been kept in cold-water tanks, provided the temperature does not drop below room temperature. They have been kept in temperatures ranging from 64 to 83 °F (18 to 28 °C). Tetras are adapted to soft, slightly acidic water, and soft water is essential for breeding. Bloodfin tetras can adapt to many water conditions in captivity, if the tap water is dechlorinated.[citation needed]

At the time of spawning the fish leaps above the water surface and leaves its eggs in the water. The eggs, being heavy, fall to the floor of the tank or water body. The female deposits 300–500 eggs.[citation needed]

The dawn tetra, panda tetra, or [Rio] Paraguay tetra (Aphyocharax nattereri) comes from the Rio Paraguay basin in Paraguay and Brazil. It is a schooling fish; suitable temperatures for the Paraguay tetra are 24 to 27 °C (75 to 81 °F). This species is omnivorous with a strong preference for animal food. It will eat normal aquarium fish food, but much prefers live food.  The dawn tetra is an egg-scattering species.[3] This tetra is very active and extremely aggressive towards fish of similar or smaller size or those that are slower moving. Not suitable for the community tank.

The silvertip tetra (Hasemania nana) is a species of characid freshwater fish omnivores native to streams and creeks in the São Francisco basin in Brazil, but frequently kept in aquariums.[2] Silvertip tetras are slightly more aggressive than other comparable smaller tetras, observed occasionally to nip other similarly sized tetras.

This small fish reaches up to 5 cm (2.0 in) in standard length.[2] The tetras are transparent with their gold colors and have a black stripe that runs along the mid to back section of their bodies. The males have brighters colors compared to the paler females. They are a social species of fish that can become territorial. They usually enjoy being with a school of their own kind.

The fish thrive in temperatures that range from 72–82 °F (22–28 °C). They live in slightly acidic waters that range from a pH of 6.0 - 8.0. They are common to find in pet stores and are relatively easy to care for. They can be affected by parasites and infections.

When they are preparing to breed, the male will be brightly colored while the female will be swollen. When they breed, the female scatters their eggs among vegetation while the male fertilizes them. The species have been known to eat their own eggs. The eggs will hatch after 1 and a half days.[3]

The genome was fully sequenced in 2013, by standard PCR, and found to be 16,581 base pairs long.[4]

The green neon tetra (Paracheirodon simulans) is a freshwater fish of the family Characidae of order Characiformes. It is native to the upper Orinoco and Negro Rivers in South America.[2]

This fish is similar in appearance to the closely related and better-known neon tetra, but it is slightly smaller, and its red patch is less pronounced, while the blue-green areas of the upper body are more brilliant. Also, its body is slimmer than that of the neon tetra. It grows to a maximum overall length of about 3.5 cm (1.4 in).

Like the other Paracheirodon species, the green neon tetra is kept as an aquarium fish, but it is less commonly seen than either the neon tetra or the cardinal tetra.

P. simulans is also sometimes called the blue or false neon. Hyphessobrycon simulans and Cheirodon simulans are obsolete synonyms.

This fish loses its brilliant blue and red colors when lights are switched off, but regains them when lights are switched on again. The green neon tetra comes from extremely soft, acidic water at temperatures around 24 to 29 °C (75 to 84 °F).

For breeding, these tetras need water similar to the waters in which they live in the wild; extremely soft water with a pH of about 6 and a temperature of around 77 °F (25 °C). Ideally, the water should be highly stained by the tannins from peat,[3] in subdued light, shaded by plants. It spawns in a school, although in the actual act of spawning, one female may be closely associated with one or more males.

About 130 eggs a batch can be laid by each female. The parents should be removed after spawning. The eggs should hatch in 24 hours. The eggs are light sensitive so avoid light(?). The babies are very small, so feeding infusoria (protozoa) is necessary early on. As they grow, this can increasingly be supplemented with fine commercial fry foods. Adults can breed again after a few weeks.

The twospot astyanax (Astyanax bimaculatus),[2][4] also called the two-spot tetra, is a small species of freshwater fish native to South America. It is a middlingly common tetra in the aquarium industry, with hobbyist reports of its sale and presence, and it is also a well-studied member of the genus Astyanax in wild settings. Amateur aquarists report peaceful schooling behavior in captivity, though fish in wild schools may turn on one another if presented with the threat of a predatory species.

Its very earliest report was by prolific taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1758, in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Linnaeus designated it a member of genus Salmo, and since then it has also been considered a member of the genus Tetragonopterus before being placed in Astyanax. Currently, A. bimaculatus is at the center of a species complex, and specific species relationships are still being deciphered in modern ichthyological studies. As it stands, no monophyly can be guaranteed from A. bimaculatus.

Astyanax bimaculatus is omnivorous, eating plants, zooplankton, and various forms of detritus. It is also known to occasionally target other fish to eat their scales. In turn, A. bimaculatus is regularly preyed upon by Hoplias malabaricus, the trahira, as well as various heron species (genus Ardea). It is also host to a variety of parasites, most often flukes (Monogenea). Further, A. bimaculatus is a farmed fish for human use, such as consumption or bait.

When first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, A. bimaculatus was given the name Salmo bimaculatus.[5][6] Throughout the 1800s, various species were named under the genus Tetragonopterus, all of which were later found to be synonymous with A. bimaculatus.[2][3] In 1912, A. bimaculatus was momentarily considered a species of genus Poecilurichthys.[7][8] The species Tetragonopterus caudomaculatus, today known as Bryconops caudomaculatus,[9] was once mistakenly identified as being a possible synonym or otherwise close relative.[10]

Astyanax bimaculatus is at the center of a species complex and species subgroup bearing its name. The subgroup in question is made up of at least 20 species, all of which are characterized by various morphological similarities.[11] These species include - but are not limited to - A. argyrimarginatus, A. clavitaeniatus, A. goyacensis, A. novae, A. rupununi, A. saltor, A. siapae, A. unitaeniatus, A. utiariti, A. validus, A. abramis, A. maculisquamis, A. borealis, and A. orbignyanus.[12] In past studies of species in this group, it has been simpler for researchers to ignore designations and consider all examined specimens to be examples of A. bimaculatus, delineating by region instead of name.[11]

In terms of genetic information, A. bimaculatus is a notably variable species. Chromosomal study reveals a distinct - and complex - cytotype, or arrangement and number of chromosomes, for populations in different regions.[11][13] Genetic diversity in the species is not lowered by the presence of waterfalls or dams that separate different populations.[14] An interesting factor in the chromosomal makeup of A. bimaculatus, specifically populations in the Amazon region, is the presence of a B microchromosome, a particularly small type of chromosome present in some birds, reptiles, and fish;[13] little is known regarding the origin and evolution of B microchomosomes.[15]

In genetic studies, many animals are diploid, which means that chromosomes arrange themselves in pairs. When the variable ""n"" represents chromosome sets, then a diploid animal's chromosome number is represented by ""2n"". For A. bimaculatus, which is indeed diploid, this number is 2n=50.[16] (To compare, this number is 2n=46 in humans.) The chromosome number 2n=50 is shared by various other species in the A. bimaculatus complex, such as A. lacustris, A. altiparanae, A. asuncionensis, and A. jacuhiensis.[17]

The genus name Astyanax originates in the Iliad, originating from the son of prince Hector, the Trojan warrior Astyanax. The specific reason for this allusion was not made clear in the nominal text, but the large, armor-like scales of type species Astyanax argentatus may be responsible. The specific name bimaculatus means ""two-spotted"", in reference to the distinct pair of markings - the humeral spot and the spot on the caudal peduncle.[18] These two spots also earn A. bimaculatus the common name ""twospot astyanax"".[19]

Astyanax bimaculatus reaches a maximum total length of 17.5 cm (6.9 in), and a maximum weight of 91.6 g (3.23 oz).[2] The scales are large, and lack distinct radii originating from a single point in the center of each; the presence of such lines was a trait once ascribed to A. bimaculatus,[20] but has since been recognized as a trait of congener A. abramis instead.[21] There are 33 lateral-line scales, 26–27 dorsal-fin rays, and 26–30 anal-fin rays.[22][23] Before taxonomic revisions, the reported variation in the numbers of fin-rays and lateral-line scales was much greater, due to separate species all being grouped under a single name.[8][24]

The back is dark-green, the sides a silver-yellow, and there is a clear silver lateral stripe. The base of the dorsal fin and the upper lobe of the caudal fin may be strongly red, pink, or yellow, with reduced coloration in the rest of the fin.[25] There is a strong black humeral spot, and another strong blotch of pigment at the base of the caudal fin that extends onto the middle caudal-fin rays; these two spots are shared amongst all members of the A. bimaculatus species complex, which is often considered one of the defining characteristics therein, even if a small handful of species do not conform, including A. elachylepis and A. varzeae.[26] Markings also characteristic of this complex include two brown vertical bars in the humeral region.[27]

Female specimens of A. bimaculatus are larger than males.[28] Bony hooks also develop on the anal and pelvic fins of sexually mature males during spawning season, then regress afterwards.[29]

Astyanax bimaculatus is an omnivorous fish with a leaning towards plant matter. Roughly 60% of the diet is vegetal in nature, and 40% of animals; of these, dicots are the most prevalent in plants, and insects the most prevalent in animals.[30] However, when presented with a shortage of food, A. bimaculatus is remarkably capable of changing its dietary composition.[31] As a further demonstration of adaptability, A. bimaculatus has been recorded following around another fish species - namely Corydoras polystictus - to take advantage of the invertebrates, detritus, and algae that C. polystictus flushes out during its foraging activity.[32]

Because it mostly eats plant matter, it serves an important role in the food chain, transferring that energy up into the animals that prey upon it. This role also allows it to transmit disease to its predators.[33]

Astyanax bimaculatus has an enormous distribution. The rivers and basins it can be found in include, but are not limited to: the Amazonas estuaries and the main channel, Apure, Araguaia, Atrato, Beni-Madre de Dios, Branco, Cauca-Magdalena-Sinu, Coppename, Suriname, Saramacca, Corentyne-Demerara, Essequibo, Guapore, Itapicuru-Mearim, lapura, middle-lower Madeira, Mamore, Maroni-Approuague, Oiapoque, Orinoco (upper and lower), Parnaiba, Purus, Putumayo, upper Tocantins, Ucayali, and upper Xingu.[34]

Though considered sedentary, A. bimaculatus (and members of its species complex) can undertake short-distance migrations if necessary.[35]

Because of its remarkable range, A. bimaculatus is tolerant of a wide range of conditions. However, it remains entirely potamodromous (freshwater), and seems to have a preference for water with a pH of 5.5–7.5.[2] Nonetheless, it can stay alive for long periods of time in suboptimal conditions; one example, documented by zoologist William Beebe in 1942, was a wide variety of aquatic life stranded in a pond that had been reduced to a mud puddle in the severe dry season of Caripito, Venezuela. Of 32 A. bimaculatus individuals trapped therein, 12 remained alive in surroundings that should not have sustained them for as long as had already been endured.[25]

The native range of A. bimaculatus ensures that it will overlap with a great deal of other aquatic species. Its relatively peaceful nature means that it can often coexist without incident, and its dietary flexibility means that ecological competition is unnecessary; if one food item is scarce, it can simply shift targets. As such, environments with high species diversity are not of issue for A. bimaculatus.[31]

One of the most comprehensive lists of species found alongside A. bimaculatus came as a result of William Beebe's discovery of a drying-up pond in Venezuela. Fascinated by the circumstances and by just how many animals had remained alive in such poor conditions, Beebe made an annotated list of all of the species he and his colleagues could identify. Fish species found therein with A. bimaculatus include, but are certainly not limited to: Ochmacanthus flabelliferus, Callichthys callichthys, Hoplosternum littorale, Farlowella acus, Copella arnoldi, Creagrutus beni, Erythrinus erythrinus, Gephyrocharax valencia, Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus, Pristella maxillaris, and Serrasalmus eigenmanni. Also in the same location were Pipa pipa, the common Surinam toad, and Rhinoclemmys punctularia, the spot-legged wood turtle.[25]

Astyanax bimaculatus has further been collected at turbid-water sites that host Crenicichla britskii, Aphyocheirodon hemigrammus, Hemigrammus marginatus, Hyphessobrycon eques, Gymnocorymbus thayeri, Ctenobrycon hauxwellianus, and Pyrrhulina vittata.[36][37]

Astyanax bimaculatus is a host to various parasites that colonize different parts of the body. Creptotrema dissimilis is a species of trematode (flatworm) that inhabits the intestines. Magnivitellinum simplex, another intestinal trematode, was first described from A. bimaculatus in Brazil.[38] Parasitic isopod Livoneca lazzari was also first described from A. bimaculatus, this time from the gill cavity.[39] The parasites most likely to infect A. bimaculatus come from Monogenea, a class of parasitic flatworms, and infections are more common during the rainy seasons.[40]

Eukaryotic microparasites of the genus Myxobolus have been found inhabiting the gill filaments of A. bimaculatus, but the disease it causes is asymptomatic for A. bimaculatus.[41]

Astyanax bimaculatus can reach up to 18 years of age.[2]

Astyanax bimaculatus is capable of year-round reproduction, though they are less likely to be in an active reproductive or maturation state during May, June, and July. In times of scarcity, energy resources can be diverted from the bodily fat or from the liver to the gonads of female specimens; males do not use the same strategy.[42] Males also demonstrate reproductive morphology considered to be more ""primitive"" in phylogeny, including how the sperm cells are formed and carried.[43] The peak of the spawning period, while it may depend on location, has been recorded in January and February.[44]

Female specimens exposed to a chemical signal called ""conspecific alarm substance"", released by other A. bimaculatus in stressful situations like a predator attack, ovulate earlier than those not exposed - but they only ovulate once, and the generated zygotes may not develop.[45] In normal spawning conditions, larger females can lay larger numbers of eggs, simply because they have more space to carry them.[44] The eggs of A. bimaculatus are weakly adhesive, and are laid in environments of low current.[46]

Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[47]

Wastewater, animal pollutants, and pesticides can all have a negative impact on a given aquatic environment. Specifically, these factors may be genotoxic, which means that they can damage cell ""building blocks"" and lead to harmful mutations (such as cancer). A. bimaculatus can be used as a biological indicator (bioindicator) of pollutants that may be genotoxic, based upon the formation of micronuclei in the red blood cells.[48] The presence of a micronucleus results from a chromosome (or chromosome fragment) that is not carried into one of the nuclei that forms during cell division, essentially being ""left behind""; this is a sign of genotoxicity.

Enzymes from kidney, gill and brain tissues of A. bimaculatus can also be tested to measure environmental impact. The enzymes that are higher or lower depend on factors from the surrounding environment, such as low oxygen, so measurements therein can indicate changes in water parameters and various pollutants.[49]

Astyanax bimaculatus is generally non-competitive and will make changes in its own behavior so that its niche is not interfered with by sympatric species; this includes environment usage and components of dietary intake.[50] Generally, it swims in schools, which increases survival for many animal species that live in groups. Laboratory testing has introduced a caveat to this, however. It displays conspecific aggression when faced with the threat of an active, chasing predator. Because predators are known to target the weakest or most isolated of a group, purposefully wounding a group member gives the predator in question an easy target, which increases the survival chances of the others.[51]

Astyanax bimaculatus is kept in captivity both by hobbyists and by scientists. In hobbyist circles, A. bimaculatus is a species known to need ample swimming space, and should not be paired with more retiring fish given its ""rambunctious"" habits.[52] Generally, however, it is non-aggressive.[53]

Researchers have experimented with using lactic acid bacteria from the intestinal tract of A. bimaculatus as a probiotic supplement for captive fish. Preliminary laboratory results are promising.[54] In turn, turmeric (Curcuma longa) has been shown to have positive histological effects on A. bimaculatus, resulting in decreased parasite activity.[55] Various anesthetics have been tested for efficacy on A. bimaculatus, which can help reduce stress levels during aquacultural procedures in captivity. An organic compound called 2-phenoxyethanol, as well as the essential oils of tea trees (Melaleuca alternifolia) and African basil (Ocimum gratissimum), have all proven effective on captive specimens; such results can be used to inform similar tests on other captive fish to ensure welfare.[56]

Astyanax bimaculatus has been evaluated by the IUCN Red List as ""Least Concern"".[1] There is almost no risk of it becoming endangered, as it is remarkably widespread and incredibly adaptable. The construction of hydroelectric dams in its native range, for example, has not depressed population numbers; in one study, populations from above and below a dam simply developed different morphological properties to cope with the changes in flow, environment, and food availability.[57] Changes in accessible dietary components also do not impede A. bimaculatus populations, as they are prepared to take advantage of whatever food sources may be nearby, given opportunistic feeding habits.[31]

龙王灯,Corynopoma riisei,剑尾脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

Corynopoma riisei, also known as the sword-tail characin, is a species of characin found in Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela.[2] It is also kept as an aquarium fish. This species is the only member of the genus Corynopoma.[3]

Corynopoma riisei have pronounced sexual dimorphism, the females being more aggressive and dominant than males.[4][5] Males have a grey-black, flag-like ornament that extends from the operculum on each side of the body.[4][5] This flag is normally held close to the body, but when trying to mate a male will extend the ornament and wave it in front of a female.[6][4][5] During courtship the flag is displayed by the males one at a time and at a right angle from its body, they will perform both ornament displays and zigzags.[5] Courtship may extend over several days in swordtail characin.[5]

The flag-like ornament is used as a food mimic to attract females.[4][5] The females will try to bite at the ornament, which is then often damaged during courtship and can possibly take up to weeks to regenerate.[6][4] Studies have shown that unfed females will respond more to the male ornament and show a preference for the larger flags than those that had been fed.[6]

This is an example of sensory exploitation because the males are exploiting the females' pre-existing bias to seem more attractive and have more opportunities to mate.[6] Males lack external gonopodia so in order for internal fertilization to occur in the female, they need to be within close proximity for the sperm to transfer successfully.[5][6] The males use this food mimic to get them within close proximity of females, and will show different ornament displays based on the attractiveness of their ornaments.[4] Males that do not show an overall large ornament size or symmetry can compensate by displaying or zigzagging their flags more often.[5] The males may also be using the hooks on the anal fin to direct the sperm for transfer.[7]

Females store viable sperm internally for up to ten months and will mate with multiple different males in their lifetime.[8] These females would be receiving indirect benefits for the offspring as they are not directly choosing which males they want to be inseminated by but are selecting a food-mimic which can be related to male attractiveness. This attractive quality could then be passed on to offspring.

This species could also be used as an example of sensory drive, males are shown to have morphological differences based on their location and prey available, the females prefer the males whose flag ornament best resembles prey items of the population they live in.[4][9] It has been demonstrated that the flag resembles an ant, because that is the most common natural prey of the swordtail characin.[4] This plasticity in mate choice can also been shown in a laboratory setting when food colour was altered the females also changed the preference for males to have a flag that matches the colour of food.[4]

Recently it has been hypothesized that the males caudal pheromone gland is used to release pheromones that decrease stress in females and increase activity.[8] This could potentially aid the males in gaining access to females and facilitating the sperm transfer.[8]

Petitella bleheri is a species of characin found in Amazon Basin in Brazil and Peru. It is one of three species commonly referred to as the rummy-nose tetra, and is also known as the  firehead tetra.[2]

The specific name, bleheri, honors the species’ discoverer, Heiko Bleher.[3]

The mitochondrial genome of Petitella bleheri was fully sequenced in 2015 using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, and found to be 17,021 base pairs long.[4]

This species is found in the Rio Negro and Rio Meta basins.[2]

Omnivorous and will accept just about anything offered. Species does have a small mouth so correspondingly sized foods are best. Feed a mixture of dried flakes and granules and small live and frozen foods. A varied diet such as this is essential for the best colour development.[citation needed]

This species is common in the aquarium trade. Between the years of 2006 to 2015, 7,178,906 specimens of Petitella bleheri were exported from the Amazonas state of Brazil, accounting for 5.04% of all fish exported from Amazonas for the ornamental fish trade during that time.[5]

红蜻蜓,Iguanodectes adujai,阿氏蜥形脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

Iguanodectes adujai is a species of freshwater fish that inhabits the rivers of South America. It largely prefers slow-moving blackwater habitats, though it has a slender body that suggests a further affinity for flowing water. It has a distinct lateral stripe in two horizontal sections, with bright-red at the top and yellow at the bottom.

Though rare, it is seen in the aquarium trade, and is sometimes captured from the wild for collection or sale. I. adujai is sometimes sold in the same stock as congener I. geisleri, due to a markedly similar appearance.

Iguanodectes adujai is a small tetra with a slender build, reaching a maximum of 6.2 cm (2.4 in) standard length (SL).[1] The general body shape has been described as similar to a smelt or minnow, something the genus Iguanodectes shares with sister genus Piabucus.[2][3][4] I. adujai specifically has pale-silver scales, a yellowish underside, and a red lateral stripe that ends in a blotch of pigmentation at the caudal fin.[5]

The lateral stripe can be used to tell two similar-looking species, Iguanodectes adujai and Iguanodectes geisleri, apart. In geisleri, the lateral stripe is three colors (red, yellow, and black, top-to-bottom), whereas in adujai it is only two (red and yellow).[6] Other identifying characteristics of I. adujai include the anal-fin origin lining up with the dorsal-fin origin (versus being located posterior to the dorsal-fin origin in I. geisleri) and 28-34 anal-fin rays (versus 20-25).[7]

There are a total of 8 accepted species in the genus Iguanodectes.[8] I. adujai is a fairly recent addition in comparison with other members, the earliest of which (Iguanodectes spilurus) was named in 1864, though considered a member of related genus Piabucus at the time. The latest additions were all named in 1993.[9] I. adujai has no known scientific synonyms, having retained its original name since discovery.[10]

In terms of a common name, I. adujai is sometimes sold under the name ""rust-stripe tetra"" or ""red line lizard tetra"".[11] It should not be confused with congener I. geisleri, which is somewhat more common and is sold under the same name.[6] I. adujai has also been sold as the ""rainbow lizard tetra"" or the ""slender tetra"".[12][13] The variety in nomenclature indicates weak consensus on how to refer to the species.

Most members of Iguanodectes are referred to as ""piaba"" in colloquial Brazilian settings.[4][14]

The specific name ""adujai"" originates from the igarapé Adujá, which is the type locality of I. adujai. ""Iguanodectes"" comes from ""iguana"", the lizard, and ""dectes"", meaning ""bite"" or ""tooth""; though it was not made clear in the original text, it is assumed that this is in reference to the ""lizard-like"" dentition.[15]

Iguanodectes adujai is known from Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia.[16] Its type locality speaks to a preference for blackwater habitats, which are characterized by plentiful riparian vegetation and a substrate largely composed of leaf litter.[7] Specifically, it was first located in the igarapé Aduja,[15] which is a tributary of the Rio Itu, located in the middle Rio Negro basin.[17]

The Rio Negro basin is well-known for its floodplains, including an area in which the Itu is located,[18] and associated flooding cycles may have an influence on I. adujai's diet and behavior. The stretch of wetlands therein is inundated with blackwater rivers.[19] Within the Itu specifically, iron deposits are not uncommon.[20] The relevant riparian vegetation largely consists of sedges and palm trees.[21]

Iguanodectes adujai is an omnivorous species, though many Iguanodectes are largely herbivores.[4] It seems to be a fairly opportunistic feeder, including crustaceans, insects, algae, fallen fruit, and leaf litter in its diet.[22] Living in a floodplain means that its food sources fluctuate with the seasons. Little else is known of its interaction with its environment and the food web in its native range.

Iguanodectes adujai has not been evaluated by the IUCN, and is thus lacking in species-specific population evaluation.[23] Nonetheless, freshwater aquatic habitats - especially wetlands - in South America are frequently under pressure from various ongoing anthropogenic hazards, including illegal mining and infrastructure development.[24]

The wetlands of South America are known for their biodiversity, but also for their fragility. As such, conservation efforts are often undertaken to protect them, which offers wetland-dwelling species like I. adujai continued stability.[19][25] Still, there are some legal and social complications surrounding protected sites therein, which may interfere with their role as sanctuaries for endemic species.[24]

Iguanodectes adujai is exported from its native habitat to various locations, including Germany and Poland, on an uncommon basis.[22][26] Aquarists describe a largely calm disposition, though males may get combative amongst themselves to establish a hierarchy.[5] It is reportedly sensitive to poor water conditions.[22]

Iguanodectes adujai and Iguanodectes geisleri are sometimes sold in the same stock and labeled as the same species because they may be difficult for the layperson to tell apart.[7]

帝王灯,Nematobrycon palmeri,巴氏丝尾脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

Nematobrycon palmeri, commonly known as the emperor tetra, is a species of characid fish found in the Atrato and San Juan river basins in western Colombia. It was first imported in the aquarium trade to the United States in 1960 and has since become well established.

Named in honor of Mervyn George Palmer (1882-1954), an English traveler who collected in Central and South America for the British Museum, and who collected the type specimen.[2]

The purple hue of these tetras will be more apparent in an aquarium with floating plants on the surface and relatively subdued lighting. If the aquarium is too bright, the yellow coloration will dominate. The body is long, slim, and flattened to about 3 inches at maturity. Looking from the eye to the tail area, you will find a black line placed within a blue stripe. The sickled shaped dorsal fin, along with the pectoral fin and anal fins are yellow. The male is larger than the female and his anal fins are longer. The male caudal is more pointed than the female.

Emperor tetras are highly sexually dimorphic and thus males and females are quite easily distinguished from each other. There are several ways to tell a male and female apart, the most reliable method is to observe the eye color. Males will have metallic blue eyes while females possess metallic green eyes. Also, the male has a three pronged tail with the medial black stripe usually extending beyond the rest of the tail, while in the females this median black stripe will typically only reach as far as the clear part of the tail. However, this is not always the best indicator as the third prong in males can sometimes be nipped off in competitions with tank mates and more dominant females may sometimes grow this extension of the tail as well.

This species should not be confused with the royal tetra Inpaichthys kerri, whose appearance and alternate common names resemble N. palmeri.

The emperor tetra is an omnivore, eating both animal and vegetable food.  Any good flake or pelleted fish food is a good basis for its diet. It will benefit from live food like daphnia and mosquito larvae as well as frozen fish food including frozen bloodworms.

In a large well planted aquarium a single pair of emperor tetras will often breed without any extra stimulation.  If there are no other fish, some of the babies may survive especially if the parents are well fed. In a large, well planted aquarium the babies will find some useful natural food in the form of protozoa, algae, etc.  Screened daphnia will provide them with more nourishment as they grow, and dry fry food can be used.

The emperor tetra is a placid aquarium fish and will be disturbed by more boisterous species. It grows to 4.2  cm.[3] It prefers a pH of 6.5, a hardness of 3-6 dKH and a temperature of 23–27 °C.
It does not school as readily as most tetras, and a pair appears happier than with most tetras. However, with the addition of fresh cool water, a large group of emperors will school across an aquarium, sometimes for several minutes.

拐棍鱼,Thayeria boehlkei,博氏企鹅鱼,脂鲤科,"

Thayeria boehlkei is a species of characin fish endemic to the Amazon River basin and Araguaia River, in Peru and Brazil respectively.[2] The species is popular with aquarium hobbyists where it is traded under a variety of common names including blackline penguinfish, blackline thayeria, hockey-stick tetra, penguin fish and penguin tetra.[2][3][4]

The fish is named in honor of James E. Böhlke (1930-1982) of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, because of his interest in and contributions to the knowledge of South American characids.[5]

Thayeria inhabits small streams and the margins of smaller rivers in the lowland Amazon basin, where it is part of the highly diverse Neotropical fish fauna.

The species was previously misidentified as Thayeria sanctaemariae[6] and Thayeria obliqua. T. obliqua is a superficially similar, but different species of Thayeria, while T. sanctaemariae, is a synonym of T. obliqua.[2]

The species feeds on worms, small insects, flake food and crustaceans.[2]

In captivity, this normally schooling species forms pairs that scatter their many adhesive eggs amongst plants. Clutch size is very large and may be up to 1000 eggs,  the embryos of which are black in colour[6][7] The eggs hatch in about 20 hours and are free-swimming after 4 days.[4]

The species is best kept in groups, to allow the species to school, in tropical freshwater community aquaria with other peaceful, non-predatory fishes.[4][7][8] This fish tolerates a fairly broad range of water pHs, but prefers acidic water for breeding.[8]

黑裙,Gymnocorymbus ternetzi,裸顶脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

The black tetra (Gymnocorymbus ternetzi), also known as the black skirt tetra, petticoat tetra, high-fin black skirt tetra, black widow tetra and blackamoor,  is a freshwater fish of the characin family (Characidae). 

It is native to the Paraguay River basin of south-central Brazil (mainly Pantanal region), Paraguay and northeast Argentina, but there are also populations in the upper Paraná and Paraíba do Sul Rivers that likely were introduced.[1] It was formerly reported from the Guapore River, but this population is part of G. flaviolimai, which is found throughout the Madeira River basin and was described in 2015.[1] The black tetra is often kept in aquariums.[2]

Growing up to 7.5 cm (3.0 in) in length,[3] the black tetra has a roughly tetragonal body shape and is greyish in colour, fading from near black at the tail to light at the nose. Two prominent, black, vertical bars appear just posterior to the gills.[1] It is easily distinguished from all of its congeners by the presence of a dense field of dark chromatophores spread homogeneously over the posterior one half of the body unlike the lack of such pigmentation in all congeners.[4]

The black widow tetra is a shoaling fish that feeds on small crustaceans, insects, and worms.[3]

The black skirt tetra is a common fish that is widely available for purchase.

Hobbyists often provide live foods such as Daphnia and mosquito larvae, and frozen foods like bloodworms.[citation needed]

The species reaches sexual maturity at about two years of age. Like most characins, this species spawns by intermittently releasing and fertilizing eggs among plants. It frequently eats its own eggs, so keepers remove the fish after spawning.

The lifespan in captivity is 3 to 5 years.

The black tetra was also used to make genetically modified fish sold as GloFish (fluorescent colored fish), available in a wide variety of colors.

The black phantom tetra (Hyphessobrycon megalopterus) is a separate species. The black neon tetra (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) is sometimes also called the black tetra.

红尾,Prionobrama filigera,玻璃锯脂鳊,脂鲤科,"

The glass bloodfin tetra, Prionobrama filigera, is a species of Characid fish native to the Amazon River basin of South America.

In the wild this fish eats mainly aquatic insect larvae and crustaceans.
In an aquarium they will readily adapt to a diet of commercial dry fish foods, but benefit from a variety of food including both live and frozen foods such as daphnia and bloodworms.

The glass bloodfin tetra is a community tank fish that would do best in a group of at least 8 fish. A well planted aquarium with a volume of 15 US gallons (57 L) would make an ideal home for this species.

Prionobrama filigera will breed successfully in harder and more alkaline water than most tetra species.  A pH of 7.3 and 10 degrees of hardness is suitable, but not the much harder water the adults can live in.
It is an egg scattering species that will eat its own eggs.

刚果扯旗,Phenacogrammus interruptus,断线脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

The Congo tetra (Phenacogrammus interruptus) is a species of fish in the African tetra family, found in the central Congo River Basin in Africa. It is commonly kept in aquaria.

The Congo tetra has a typical full-bodied tetra shape with rather large scales. When mature, the iridescent colors of the Congo tetra run through the fish from front to back, starting with blue on top changing to red through the middle, to yellow-gold, and back to blue just above the belly. It is not its fluorescent colors that make this tetra so distinct, but rather its tail fin, which develops into a grayish-violet feathery appendage with white edges. The males get up to 3.0 inches (8.5 cm). Females up to 2.75 inches (6 cm). The male is larger with more color, also the tail fin and dorsal fin are more extended.[2] They also have different colors and extensions in the caudal fin.

Congo tetra are a popular aquarium species. However, their large size and active behavior makes them unsuited for most smaller tanks. They easily adapt to captive diets like pellets and frozen foods, though they will still hunt down live foods when offered. They have successfully been bred in captivity and captive bred individuals are commonly available. Whilst they can be kept healthy on a slightly wider range of water parameters, breeding often requires water parameters more similar to their natural habitat. Bad water quality has been known to affect male fin development and lead to loss of coloration.[3]

The Congo Tetra is a moderately hardy freshwater fish. This species thrives in a well-maintained aquarium that mimics its natural, slightly acidic and soft-water habitat. Optimal health for Congo Tetras is achieved in a stable environment with good water quality, a balanced pH level of around 6.0 to 7.5, and temperatures between 72°F and 82°F. A varied diet, including quality flake food, frozen or live brine shrimp, and bloodworms, is essential for maintaining their vibrant colors and overall vitality.

Common diseases affecting Congo Tetras include Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich), a parasitic infection manifesting as white spots on the body and fins, and fin rot, often due to poor water quality. Preventive care is key, emphasizing regular water changes, tank cleanliness, and avoiding overfeeding. Quarantining new fish before introducing them to the main tank is crucial to prevent the spread of diseases. In case of illness, early detection and treatment, often involving specific medications and improved tank conditions, are vital for recovery.[3] Proper care and attention to their environmental needs ensure these stunning fish remain a healthy and dynamic part of any aquarium community.

The IUCN lists the Congo tetra as a species of Least Concern.
"
三带铅笔鱼,Nannostomus trifasciatus,三带铅笔鱼,脂鲤科,"

Nannostomus trifasciatus, (from the Greek: nanos = small, and the Latin stomus = relating to the mouth; from the Latin: trifasciatus = three bands),[1][2] commonly known as the three-lined or three-stripe pencilfish, is a freshwater species of fish  belonging to the characin family Lebiasinidae. They are popular in the aquarium trade due to their small size, beautiful color pattern, and relative hardiness.

Steindachner first described the species in 1876, making it one of the first four species in the genus to be described. As a result of the broad distribution of N. trifasciatus, the species is polymorphic and, over the years, some of these color morphs have been erroneously described as separate species. Poecilobrycon erythrurus and Poecilobrycon vittatus, two such examples, are now known to be junior synonyms.

N. trifasciatus inhabits slow-moving, slightly acidic waters.  Within these conditions, it is found in several different habitat types. It has a broad distribution throughout the Amazon basin, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, northern Bolivia, and the Guianas. In the Rio Negro, it inhabits the large swamps that form where tributaries meet the main branch of the river. When the river floods, it moves into the inundated rainforest. During the low-water season, it often becomes trapped in small lakes that are left behind, or stays close to the wooded edges of the forest. N. trifasciatus rests near the water surface at night and during the day inhabits the middle to upper water layers.

The three-lined pencilfish is a small fish, with adults not reaching more than 6 cm in length. It has a small terminal mouth, and an adipose fin may or may not be present. Most pencilfish  possess distinct daytime and nighttime color patterns, and N. trifasciatus is no exception. During the day, it has three black longitudinal stripes that run the length of the body. At night, three large dark spots materialize on the sides of the fish, extending from its back to its belly. Research has shown that this change in coloration is due to the differential action of the pineal hormone melatonin on pigment cells in different regions of the integument. The daytime color pattern may serve an aposematic or recognition function for individuals of the same species, and the nighttime pattern may help hide the fish from nocturnal predators. In between the variable, darkly pigmented regions, N. trifasciatus is greenish-gold in color on its back and sides and silver underneath. The gill cover and dorsal, pelvic, anal, and caudal fins possess red blotches, varying in size depending on the population. N. trifasciatus has often been confused in aquarium literature with N. marginatus which is also a three-striped pencilfish; however, the latter species can be distinguished by its smaller size and blockier profile.

Sexual dimorphism in this species is the least evident of the many species in the genus Nannostomus. The anal fin of males, which is often modified in shape or is more colorful in many Nannostomus species, is not modified or more colorful in N. trifasciatus. Males of the species may have an additional row of red spots in the gold area between the middle and uppermost stripes, but this is extremely variable even within populations. Males are sometimes slimmer and more colorful than females, but once again, this is  variable.

N. trifasciatus is omnivorous and spends much of its time near the water surface, where it feeds primarily on insects. It is also an avid biofilm grazer, ingesting microorganisms, as well as algae.

N. trifasciatus is a popular and appropriate community aquarium species, if tankmates are of similar size and demeanor, and will thrive if kept in soft, mildly acidic water at temperatures between 72 and 82 °F. Baby brine shrimp and other small-sized foods are indicated. Males establish and defend small territories. The species  spawns during the daytime among plant leaves. The eggs are adhesive and are most often placed on plants. Fertilization takes place externally, and 30-100 eggs are produced at a time. The eggs hatch in 24–72 hours, depending on the water temperature.  If well-fed, and if sufficient plant cover is provided, breeders will not eat eggs and fry will be found among floating plants. This species is seldom spawned in captivity and has never been commercially raised in fisheries. The aquarium trade relies exclusively on wild-caught specimens.

This pattern of patches is assumed by other species at night, but only N. espei displays the pattern permanently and in daylight.

The fish is named in honor of ornamental fish importer-exporter Heinrich Espe, who furnished specimens to Meinken for identification.[3]

一线铅笔鱼,Nannostomus unifasciatus,单线铅笔鱼,脂鲤科,"

Nannostomus unifasciatus,  (from the Greek: nanos = small, and the Latin stomus = relating to the mouth; from the Latin: unifasciatus = one band),[1][2] commonly known as the one-lined pencilfish, is a freshwater species of fish  belonging to the genus Nannostomus in the characin family Lebiasinidae. They are popular in the aquarium trade due to their small size, beautiful color pattern, unique swimming posture and relative hardiness.[1] With its long, pencil-shaped profile, its single jet black stripe reminiscent of the graphite core of a pencil, and its eraser-colored caudal fin, this is the species for which the popular name, 'pencilfish', was first coined in the 1920s, later to be applied to all the species of the genus Nannostomus.[1][3][4]

Steindachner first described the species in 1876, making it the second of what are now nineteen  species in the genus to be described.[5][6] The taxonomy for the entire genus was for many decades the subject of heated debate, resulting in numerous conflicting revisions, leaving the genus for long periods in a state which has been aptly described as 'chaotic.'[7] N. unifasciatus was often at the center of this controversy and this for several reasons.[8] N. unifasciatus, is broadly distributed throughout the Amazon basin, in Brazil, the Guiana Shield, Colombia, Venezuela, and northern Bolivia.[6]  As a result, the species is polychromatic with many geographic populations manifesting subtle differences in color pattern. Over the years, some of these color morphs have been erroneously described as separate species.[8] Further taxonomic confusion arose when various authors erected other genera for Nannostomus unifasciatus and its congeners, Nannostomus eques and Nannostomus harrisoni. Confounding the situation still further, Dutch naturalist, J. J. Hoedeman published a paper in The Amsterdam Naturalist in 1950 that put forth that N. unifasciatus and N. eques were one and the same species.[7] Consensus was finally achieved when, in his seminal paper on the genus Nannostomus  in 1975, Dr. Stanley Howard Weitzman restored Steindachner's taxonomy and expanded upon it, reaffirming the status of N. unifasciatus and N. eques as distinct and individuated species, and placing N. unifasciatus and all of its congeners in one genus, Nannostomus.[8] As a result, 'Poecilobrycon ocellatus,' 'Nannobrycon unifasciatus,' and similar epithets formerly applied to the species, are now relegated to junior synonyms to N. unifasciatus.[8] A population of the species has also been discovered on the island of Trinidad, but it is believed to have been introduced.[6]

Nannostomus unifasciatus commonly inhabits slow-moving tributaries, small rivers, and swampy areas throughout its substantial range. Dense aquatic vegetation and/or submerged branches and leaf litter are most often present. They also congregate beneath floating islands.[6] Water parameters invariably range from slightly acidic (pH 6.5) to strongly acidic (pH 4.0) with negligible hardness.[6] Their congener, N. eques, is often found associated with them nearby, along with numerous other species of small characins.[6]

Though the one-lined pencilfish is a small fish, with adults not reaching more than 7 cm in length, it is nevertheless one of the largest species of Nannostomus.[8] It is a long slender species with a small terminal mouth, and an adipose fin.[6]  It has one black longitudinal stripe that runs the length of the body and onto the caudal fin.  The single black stripe is bordered above by a thin metallic gold band. The caudal is colored variously depending on the geographic population.[8] Most all forms have red or orange pigment of varying intensity in the lower quadrant of the caudal, ventral to the black stripe. In some especially colorful populations, the red pigment extends above the black stripe as well, as pictured above.[1] The Guyanese population, as well as one form from Bolivia, manifest a well-defined caudal ocellus above the black stripe.[8] The ventral and anal fins are usually tipped with an enamel blue-white.  N. unifasicatus is one of two species of Nannostomus, the other being Nannostomus eques, that postures itself at an oblique, snout-up angle.  Because of this similarity, N. unifasciatus and N. eques have often been confused in aquarium literature, though they are colored entirely differently from each other.[1] Nannostomus harrisoni, another long, slender single-striped species, is also often confused with N. unifasciatus based on a similar profile and coloration, but N. harrisoni swims in a horizontal posture and possesses bright red adornments on its anal and ventral fins, absent in N. unifasciatus.[5]

Sexual dimorphism in this species is typical of many species in the genus Nannostomus. The anal fin of males is modified in shape in most populations, the male's fin being slightly elongated. It is the least evident in the Guyanese population. The white tips of the ventral and anal fins are invariably brighter and more prominent on males. Males are also usually slimmer in profile.[5]

Nannostomus unifasciatus is omnivorous and  feeds primarily on insects and small crustaceans. It is also an avid periphyton grazer, ingesting microorganisms as well as algae.[9]

Though it has gone through periodic episodes of scarcity in the aquarium trade,[1][4][10] N. unifasciatus has long been considered a most desirable aquarium species, Dr. William T. Innes describing them as possessing ""a marked elegance"" and manifesting ""that indefinable something known as class"" in 1935.[1]  It is an appropriate community aquarium species, if tankmates are of similar size and demeanor, and will thrive if kept in soft, mildly acidic water, low nitrate levels, and at temperatures between 72F and 82F.[3] Baby brine shrimp and other small-sized foods are indicated.[11]  Males will establish and defend small territories. Unlike its congener, N. eques, which prefers the upper strata of the aquarium, N. unifasciatus tends to congregate in the mid to lower reaches.[9] This is the only species of Nannostomus in the aquarium trade for which there is no recorded account of a successful spawning in captivity to date, this despite it being a widely kept and much admired aquarium species since the 1920s.[4][10][11] Two reports of purported successful spawnings in the 1950s, published in aquarium literature—one in the Belgian magazine, ""Notre Aquarium,"" and the other in the American magazine, ""The Aquarium""—involved misidentification of the species, the spawnings having occurred for N. eques and N. harrisoni respectively, not N. unifasciatus.[9][11][3]

火焰铅笔鱼,Nannostomus marginatus,短铅笔鱼,脂鲤科,"

Nannostomus marginatus, (from the Greek: nanos = small, and the Latin stomus = relating to the mouth; from the Latin: marginatus = marginated),[1][2] commonly known as the dwarf pencilfish, is a freshwater species of fish belonging to the genus Nannostomus in the characin family Lebiasinidae.[3] They were first described in 1909 by C. H. Eigenmann and are typical of members of this genus being small, elongated fish with prominent horizontal stripes.  The most notable feature of N. marginatus is its size, it being one of the smallest members of the genus, only reaching a maximum size of 35 mm. They occur widely on the South American continent having been recorded in Brazil, Guyana, Colombia, Suriname, and Peru, and have been a popular aquarium species since their introduction to aquarists in the early twentieth century. [4]

The common name given to  N. marginatus is typically dwarf pencilfish, reflecting its diminutive size, although it is not the smallest known member of the genus since both N. minimus and N. anduzei are smaller possessing a maximum length of only 23mm and 16mm respectively. N. marginatus picturatus, a variant described by Hoedeman in 1954, is now regarded as a junior synonym.

It occurs quite widely in South America, having been recorded in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Guyana.[4] It is also quite commonly met with in the aquarium trade where its habit of swimming and posturing at a 'snout-up' angle—one of two Nannostomus species to do so, the other being Nannostomus unifasciatus—makes it a popular choice.[5]

Nannostomus harrisoni, (from the Greek: nanos = small, and the Latin stomus = relating to the mouth; harrisoni = in honor of geologist, John Burchmore Harrison),[1][2] is a species of pencil fish.  Native to The Guianas, the species displays a single horizontal stripe of intense black, and blood red adornments on its fins.  N. harrisoni is often confused with Nannostomus unifasciatus, another long, slender, single-striped species with similar profile and coloration, but N. harrisoni swims in a horizontal posture, as opposed to the snout-up oblique posture of N.unifasciatus, and the bright red adornments on the ventral fins of N. harrisoni are absent in N. unifasciatus. Though the recently described species N. grandis has been dubbed the largest member of the genus, adults of N. harrisoni commonly grow to a length of 70 mm, making it in fact the largest species of pencil fish described to date. It is commonly known as Harrison's pencilfish.[3]

The  fish is named  in honor of John Burchmore Harrison (1856-1928), a Government Geologist in Georgetown, British Guiana, for his assistance during Eigenmann's 1908 expedition to the region.[4]

The black-winged hatchetfish (Carnegiella marthae) is a freshwater ray-finned fish native to South America.[1]

George Myers named this fish after his first wife Martha.[2]

Black-winged hatchetfish has a convex body. It has a very deep ventral profile with its anal fin set back. This species has wing-like pectoral fins that often extend to half of the fish's body length. In general, coloration is silver with black patches and stripes but, depending on the angle of light, colors may vary. A stripe that is usually gold stretches horizontally from the gill cover the base of the tail. Black-winged hatchetfish can reach up to 2.8 cm (1.1 in) in length.

Black-winged hatchetfish live in the calm streams and pools of the Orinoco and Negro region in South America. They can be found in Brazil and Venezuela.[3]

Black-winged hatchetfish are omnivorous. They can be fed live as well as flake foods. In the wild, they feed mainly at the surface for insects, but can also eat crustaceans.

Black-winged hatchetfish are peaceful fish that will do well with many other types of tropical fish such as smaller species of catfish and tetras. Make sure that there are small floating plants. Cover every hole at the top of the aquarium because in the wild, hatchetfish catch insects by jumping out of the water. Blackwinged hatchetfish inhabit the top of the aquarium.

阴阳燕子,Carnegiella strigata,飞脂鲤,脂鲤科,"

The marbled hatchetfish (Carnegiella strigata) is a small, normally 3.5 cm (1.4 in) in length, freshwater ray-finned fish native to South America.  Hatchet shaped, it presents a gold line extending from its eye to its caudal fin while the area below has a brown and cream colored marble-like pattern (hence its name).

The marbled hatchetfish is common in the aquarium industry.  Like most Amazonian fish, the species prefers softer, acidic water. As with most characins, they are omnivores. Hatchets have a tendency to be shy fish and are easily intimidated by larger or fast moving fish, so they are only appropriate for very peaceful communities or species tanks. The marbled hatchetfish is usually kept in small schools. It is necessary for tanks inhabited by these fish to have a tight lid, as they can jump out when startled. Marbled hatchetfish are egg scatterers and have been bred in the aquarium hobby.

Marbled hatchetfish are adapted to life in the Amazonian rivers as they resemble a dead leaf floating sideways on the surface of a body of water. This camouflage protects them against potential predators that may be lurking in the water. Their marble-like pattern is to give the illusion of rays of light breaking the waters surface and reflecting on the portrayed leaf. The fish itself does not move much, letting the waves and currents move it mostly, but with occasional brief twitching movements. This replicates the way a leaf would be blown around or carried away by the tide or a current. The line running from its eye, to its tail, is believed to replicate the midrib (midvein) of a leaf.

银燕子,Gasteropelecus sternicla,胸斧鱼,脂鲤科,"

The common hatchetfish or river hatchetfish (Gasteropelecus sternicla) is a tropical fish belonging to the freshwater hatchetfish family (Gasteropelecidae). Originating in South America in the Peruvian and middle Amazon, the Guianas and Venezuela, it grows to about 2.5 inches (6.4 cm). The fish gets its name from its relatively large protruding belly which resembles a hatchet. Hatchetfish will often jump out of the water when alarmed, propelled by their large, winglike pectoral fins. They also jump to catch small aerial insects.

The river hatchetfish is a schooling species best kept in groups of five or more that spends most of its time in the top-level of the water where it searches for food. These fish are peaceful towards other fishes, but frequently bicker among themselves. Typical lifespan in captivity is around five years, but can live longer. They come from streams in a tropical climate and prefer water at pH 6–7, a water hardness of up to 15.0 dGH, and an ideal temperature range of 23–27 °C (73–81 °F) . As carnivores, they will readily eat many types of small annelid worms, insects, and crustaceans, and they will also eat standard flake foods. They have a reputation for being greedy fish.

Because of their natural tendency to jump when alarmed, they may jump out of aquarium tanks. To prevent this, the top must either be completely sealed, or the water level lowered so the edges of the tank extend further upwards than the fish are capable of jumping. This is also less common with the addition of floating plants, to provide cover. It is also advised to keep them in a planted aquarium.

大银斧鱼,Thoracocharax stellatus,星银斧鱼,脂鲤科,"

Gastropelecus stellatus Kner, 1858

Thoracocharax stellatus, the silver hatchetfish, spotfin hatchetfish, spotted hatchetfish or platinum hatchetfish, is a widespread hatchetfish found throughout South America including Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina[1] in the Amazon, Orinoco, Paraguay and Tocantins-Araguaia basins.[2] This species is one of the largest of the hatchetfishes. It is usually found in areas with abundant riparian vegetation.[1]

A typical hatchetfish, Thoracocharax stellatus is superficially similar to Thoracocharax securis, but has a prominent dark spot in the dorsal-fin. In the wild, adults vary in length between 21–55mm,[3] but in captivity, can grow up to between 60–70mm,[1] maximum length is 80mm.

The genus Thoracocharax is monophyletic and is sister to Carnegiella and Gasteropelecus. Thoracocharax stellatus has four distinct lineages suggesting this species may represent a species complex.[4] The four lineages are found in the following rivers:

The genus name, Thoracocharax, is derived from the Greek θώραξ (thṓraks), meaning breastplate or cuirass coupled with the word Charax, type genus of the Order Characiformes, which comes from the Ancient Greek χάραξ (chárax), meaning a palisade of pointed sticks, in reference to the densely packed sharp teeth of the fish. The species epithet, stellatus, is Latin for starry or studded with stars, a reference to the fish's platinum-coloured shiny appearance.[1]

In the wild, feeding occurs at sunrise and sunset, and analysis of the stomach contents of 88 specimens indicates that this species is mostly insectivorous (99.6% of stomach contents were insects) and consisted mostly of ants, beetles, and mayflies.[5] Thoracocharax stellatus appears to be a specialist on terrestrial insects and feeds by leaping out of the water and taking insects from riparian vegetation.[5]

Because of this fish's propensity to jump several meters out of water for feeding, a cover or lid may be necessary or floating plants over the water's surface.[1] An Amazon biotope-style tank is preferred (e.g. driftwood branches, sand substrate, leaf litter).[1] Breeding is difficult, but possible in single-species tanks.[6]

Pterois russelii, the largetail turkeyfish, plaintail firefish, plaintail turkeyfish, Russell's firefish, Russell's lionfish, spotless butterfly-cod or the spotless firefish, is a species of ray-finned fish with venomous spines belonging to the family Scorpaenidae, the scorpionfishes and lionfishes. It is native to the Indo-Pacific Ocean from the eastern part of Africa to the Persian Gulf.

Pterois russelii was first formally described in 1831 by the English naturalist Edward Turner Bennett with the type locality given as Coromandel Coast in India.[4] Molecular studies, and some morphological data too, have indicated that this species and the luna lionfish (P. lunulata) are the same species, P. russelii.[5] The specific name honours the Scottish surgeon and herpetologist Patrick Russell, who had illustrated and described, without naming, this species in 1803. Bennett, misspelt Russell's name by leaving out the final l, as Cuvier and Valenciennes did on a consistent basis.[6]

Pterois russelii has 13 spines and between 10 and 12 soft rays in its dorsal fin and 3 spines and 7 or 8 soft rays in its anal fin.[3] It has a whitish body striped vertically with reddish brown.[7] This species has no rows of small dark spots on the soft dorsal, anal and caudal fins which are a feature of related species, and it has comparatively short dorsal-fin spines.[8] The maximum published standard length of Russell's lionfish is 30 cm (12 in).[3]

Pterois russelii has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution from the coast of eastern Africa as far south as South Africa. It then occurs from Oman east to Japan and Australia.[1] It has been recorded in the Red Sea but this was only confirmed in 2016.[9] In Australian waters Russell's lionfish is found from the Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia around the northern tropical coasts to the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland.[8] It occurs at depths of 15 to 60 m (49 to 197 ft),[3] where it is found in areas of muddy substrate in shletered shallow estuaries, bays and coastal waters down to deeper waters in quiet offshore reefs.[8]

Pterois russelii is a solitary species which has venom bearing spines.[3] It feeds on smaller fishes, crabs and shrimp.[7]

Pterois russelii is infrequently found in the aquarium trade.[7]

毕加索,Rhinecanthus aculeatus,叉斑锉鳞鲀,鲀形目,"

The lagoon triggerfish (Rhinecanthus aculeatus), also known as the blackbar triggerfish, the Picasso triggerfish, or the Picassofish, is a triggerfish, up to 30 cm in length, found on reefs in the Indo-Pacific region.[2]

This species has been studied in a range of research contexts, from locomotion to color vision research.

Lagoon triggerfish live in the reefs and sandy areas of coral reefs, where they eat just about anything that comes along, mostly including invertebrates and reef algae. They are always restlessly swimming around and vigorously protect their territory against intruders, including divers, especially when guarding their eggs during reproduction season. Their relatively small size makes them much less dangerous than the larger titan triggerfish of the same family.[citation needed]

The fish moves through the water by using waving motions in its dorsal and anal fins, allowing it to move more precisely. Using these movements, it can move forwards, backwards or simply hover in place above the reef. This means that it can more easily back out of crevices than other unidirectional fish.[citation needed]

Both sexes guard territories, some maintaining a territory for eight years or longer (with males holding territories for significantly longer than females). A typical male territory may overlap with one to five female territories, and their mating system is described as haremic, although not much is known about this (similar mating systems are seen in other Balistidae species). If a male or female is removed or disappears their territories are soon taken over by a new fish. They reproduce multiple times over their lifetimes.[3]

Pair-spawning takes place around sunrise, with the egg masses being attached to sand, coral rubble or algae. They hatch on the same day around sunset. Although paternal care is normal in teleost fishes with external fertilization, it is the mothers in this species that guard and care for eggs until they hatch. The mother remains above the eggs for about 12–14 hours, fanning the eggs with her pectoral fins to improve aeration for perhaps 30% of the time. She chases away most fish that approach and remove other intruders like starfish by mouth. Maternal care is effective in preventing predation, and experimental removal of the mothers reduced survival to almost nothing suggesting this behaviour is adaptive. Unlike fathers, mothers forage less and over a smaller area near the egg mass while caring for the eggs. Since the males have multiple mates, caring for an egg mass would probably be more costly in terms of lost mating opportunities so maternal care is considered to be an evolutionarily stable strategy.[3]

This species has one type of single cone (SC), with an opsin peaking in sensitivity at 413 nm (S),[4] and a double cone with two different opsins in each member peaking at 480 nm (M) and 530 nm (L) respectively.[5] Behavioural research has provided evidence that individual members of the double cones can act as independent channels of colour information, aiding in understanding double cone function.[6] This research suggests the species has trichromatic vision, like humans.

黑肚炮弹,Rhinecanthus verrucosus,毒锉鳞鲀,鲀形目,"

The blackbelly triggerfish (Rhinecanthus verrucosus) is a ray-finned fish in the family Balistidae found in the Indo-Pacific. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It is sometimes known as the blackpatch triggerfish.

The blackbelly triggerfish has a laterally compressed, deep body and a long snout. In shape it is rhomboidal and it grows to a maximum length of 23 cm (9.1 in). The mouth is at the tip of the snout and the eye is set high on a long, straight forehead. The upper half of the body is pale brown and the underparts are white. There is a dark brown streak below the eye and a very large black spot on the underside just anterior to the anal fin. There are three short rows of forward pointing spines on the caudal peduncle. The anterior part of the dorsal fin consists of three spines which can be retracted into a groove and the separate posterior part has 23–26 soft rays. The anal fin is very much the same shape as the posterior dorsal fin and has 21–23 soft rays. The pectoral fin has 13–14 rays. The pelvic fin is covered by a flap of skin except for its extreme tip.[3][4]

The blackbelly triggerfish is native to shallow areas of the Indo-Pacific where it ranges from the Seychelles and Chagos Islands to Japan, Vanuatu, and Australia. A likely aquarium release was sighted near Boca Raton, Florida in 1995.[3]

The blackbelly triggerfish is a territorial species and defends its territory against other triggerfish including the lagoon triggerfish (Rhinecanthus aculeatus). Its habitat is lagoons and reef flats where it favours areas with seaweed, corals, seagrasses, sandy flats, and stony places. It may move from place to place according to the status of the tide.[3]

The redtoothed triggerfish (Odonus niger) is a triggerfish of the tropical Indo-Pacific area, and the sole member of its genus.[1] Some other common names include blue triggerfish, redfang triggerfish, redtoothed filefish, and Niger triggerfish.

Redtoothed triggerfish are normally deep purple with bluish-green markings on their heads and glowing light blue margins on the tail lobes and fins. Just like other fish in the family Balistidae, the tail is lyre-shaped. The mouth of the triggerfish seems to be grinning and it maintains tiny red teeth that are needle-sharp with two teeth in the upper jaw which can be seen when its mouth is closed. These triggerfish are one of the more peaceful triggers in the family but can become threatening with age and can perform a grunting-type sound. They can change their color depending on their mood, food, feeding, and water quality from purple to blue and bluish-green.

Their pectoral fins are quite small; as a result, they steer mostly with their dorsal and anal fins, which makes them very maneuverable, and they also use these fins to move with an exotic type of propulsion reminiscent of a propeller. It is one of the most singular swimming styles in the ocean.

Redtoothed triggerfish may inhabit reef channels or long slopes that have strong water currents. They survive by hiding under between rocks and crevices so they don't get swept away by the water currents. They also may live in the coastal shallow inshore waters at depths of around 30 – 100 feet (9 – 30 meters). Redtoothed triggerfish are mostly planktivorous eaters. They can form schools and normally feed on zooplankton which gets carried by the currents. Sponges are another part of their diet. They are also known to be carnivorous and can eat many different types of animals such as krill, clams, squid, urchins, and small fish.

The redtoothed triggerfish live in the widespread Indo-Pacific Ocean and Red Sea. They are found at the African east coast to Marquesas and Society islands. They can also be found as far north as Southern Japan and as far south as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.

The redtoothed triggerfish have distinct pairing. They meet at mating grounds where males set up their territories. They build nests to lay their eggs in. The females take care of the eggs while both males and females guard the eggs waiting for them to hatch. While they can breed in the wild, they can not breed in aquariums.

The hawkfish anthias (Serranocirrhitus latus), also known as the swallowtail basslet, coral perch,  hawk anthias, fathead anthias, or sunburst anthias,  is a species of marine ray-finned fish, an anthias from the subfamily Anthiinae part of the family Serranidae, the groupers and sea basses. It is the only member of the genus Serranocirrhitus. It is found in the Western Pacific Ocean. It is sometimes found in the aquarium trade.

The hawkfish anthias has a deep body, notably deeper than other members of the subfamily Anthiinase, and elongated pectoral fins that reach to the rear part of the anal fin.[3] Overall it is pinkish in colour with each scale having a bright yellow to orange marking. There are two bright yellow stripes radiating from the back of the eye and a yellow spot on the operculum.[4] The dorsal fin has 10 spines and 18–20 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7 soft rays. The maximum total length attained is 13 centimetres (5.1 in).[2]

The hawkfish anthias is distributed from southern Japan, where it occurs in the Ryukyu and Izu Islands, and Taiwan south to the Great Barrier Reef and Palau. It occurs as far west as the Moluccas and east to Tonga.[1]

The hawkfish anthias is found in inshore waters in the vicinity of coral reefs, small groups may occur near caves, overhangs and drop-offs,[2] at depths of 10 to 70 metres (33 to 230 ft).[1] It can be found singly or in small groups and tends to be a secretive species which frequently swims upside down under overhangs or cave ceilings.[2] They are faithful to a specific shelter.[1] Their diet consists mainly of zooplankton.[5] Hawkfish anthias are protogynous hermaphrodites and when a male in a loose aggregation dies or dis appears the dominant female changes sex to become the male.[3]

The hawkfish anthias was first formally described by Masao Watanbe in 1949 with the type locality given as Itoman, Okinawa, in the Ryukyus.[6] Watanabe placed the new species in the monospecific genus Serranocirrhitus within the hawkfish family, Cirrhitidae. In 1962 the Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley described a new species which he also placed in a monospecific genus and named Dactylanthias mcmichaeli, although he placed this species in the grouper family Serranidae, as one of the anthias. Later John E. Randall and Phillip C. Heemstra were able to show that S. latus and D. mcmichaeli were synonymous and that the species should be placed in the subfamily Anthiinea of the Serranidae.[3] It is the only species in its genus.[7]

The hawkfish anthias is rare in the aquarium trade[3] although it is highly sought after and some populations have declined due to harvesting for this trade.[4]

血红鹰,Cirrhitops fasciatus,条纹鬚䱵,鲀形目,"

The redbarred hawkfish ( Cirrhitops fasciatus)  is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a hawkfish belonging to the family Cirrhitidae. It is endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago in the Pacific Ocean.

The redbarred hawkfish was first formally described in 1828 as Cirrhites fasciatus by the English naturalist Edward Turner Bennett with the type locality given as the Hawaiian Islands.[3] In 1829 Georges Cuvier described a species with the same name with the type locality given as Puducherry in India which Albert Günther mistakenly thought predated Turner's description. Günther devised the new name Cirrhites cinctus to replace Turner's original name but Cuvier published his name a year after Bennett published, meaning Cuvier's name was invalid and Günther's replacement name unnecessary. Cirrhites was a common misspelling of Cirrfitus.[4] In 1951 the South African ichthyologist J.L.B. Smith described the new genus Cirrhitops with Cirrhites fasciatus as the type species. When he described the genus Smith stated that it was monotypic.[5] The species was known from the southwestern Indian Ocean and its type locality of Hawaii and no records came from between these places, Cuvier's locality of India for his name being an error. In 2008, in a paper co-authored by John Ernest Randall and Jennifer K. Schultz, a new species Cirrhitops mascarenensis was described from the south western Indian Ocean based on genetic and morphological analyses. This then resolved the status of the redbarred hawkfish as a species endemic to the Hawaiian archipelago.[4] The specific name fasciatus means “banded”, referring the four thick bands on the body.[6]

The redbarred hawkfish has the higher 2 and lower 6 pectoral fin rays with no branching. There are 10 spines Nd  14, occasionally 15, soft rays in the dorsal fin the spines all have a tassel of cirri at their tip and moderate incisions on the membranes between them, except that there is a deep incision between the fifth and sixth spines. The roof of the mouth has a small number of small teeth. The upper three fifths of the margin of the preoperculum has large serrations, the rest of the margin of it is smooth. The dorsal profile of the snout is convex. The caudal fin is truncate and the pelvic fin extends past the anus.[7] This species attains a maximum total length of 12.7 cm (5.0 in).[2] The background colour of the head and body is whitish with reddish or brown vertical bands on the flanks and back and speckling on the face.[8]

The redbarred hawkfish is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, records from Madagascar and the Mascerene Islands refer to Cirrhitops mascarenensis and the record from Japan is a misidentification. This species is found at depths between 1 and 52 m (3 ft 3 in and 170 ft 7 in) on a range of reef habitats and habitats associated with reefs.[1]

The redbarred hawkfish is benthic.[2] Like other hawkfishes it perches on corals and sponges to watch for prey[8] which may be small fishes, and crustaceans, as well as a small amount of sipunculids and zooplankton  such  as larval shrimps, copepods, amphipods and larval gastropods.[2]

The redbarred hawkfish is occasionally found in the aquarium trade.[8]

红牙鳞魨,Odonus niger,红牙鳞鲀,鲀形目,"

The redtoothed triggerfish (Odonus niger) is a triggerfish of the tropical Indo-Pacific area, and the sole member of its genus.[1] Some other common names include blue triggerfish, redfang triggerfish, redtoothed filefish, and Niger triggerfish.

Redtoothed triggerfish are normally deep purple with bluish-green markings on their heads and glowing light blue margins on the tail lobes and fins. Just like other fish in the family Balistidae, the tail is lyre-shaped. The mouth of the triggerfish seems to be grinning and it maintains tiny red teeth that are needle-sharp with two teeth in the upper jaw which can be seen when its mouth is closed. These triggerfish are one of the more peaceful triggers in the family but can become threatening with age and can perform a grunting-type sound. They can change their color depending on their mood, food, feeding, and water quality from purple to blue and bluish-green.

Their pectoral fins are quite small; as a result, they steer mostly with their dorsal and anal fins, which makes them very maneuverable, and they also use these fins to move with an exotic type of propulsion reminiscent of a propeller. It is one of the most singular swimming styles in the ocean.

Redtoothed triggerfish may inhabit reef channels or long slopes that have strong water currents. They survive by hiding under between rocks and crevices so they don't get swept away by the water currents. They also may live in the coastal shallow inshore waters at depths of around 30 – 100 feet (9 – 30 meters). Redtoothed triggerfish are mostly planktivorous eaters. They can form schools and normally feed on zooplankton which gets carried by the currents. Sponges are another part of their diet. They are also known to be carnivorous and can eat many different types of animals such as krill, clams, squid, urchins, and small fish.

The redtoothed triggerfish live in the widespread Indo-Pacific Ocean and Red Sea. They are found at the African east coast to Marquesas and Society islands. They can also be found as far north as Southern Japan and as far south as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.

The redtoothed triggerfish have distinct pairing. They meet at mating grounds where males set up their territories. They build nests to lay their eggs in. The females take care of the eggs while both males and females guard the eggs waiting for them to hatch. While they can breed in the wild, they can not breed in aquariums.

Chaetodermis penicilligerus, also known as the prickly leather-jacket or tasselled leather-jacket, is a  demersal marine fish belonging to the family Monacanthidae. This fish is in the monotypic genus Chaetodermis. It occasionally makes its way into the marine aquarium fish trade.[1]

The prickly leather-jacket is a medium-sized fish which grows up to 31 cm (12 in).[2]
The body is highly compressed laterally, stocky, the mouth is terminal; the head size is big proportionally to the body.
Dermal appendages are visible mainly on the body's margin and also on the sides. They are part of the fish's camouflage system.

It is widely distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, Red Sea, Persian Gulf and South Africa excluded, to the central islands of the Pacific Ocean.[2]

The background coloration of the body is light brown or sand-colored with dark longitudinal lines and blotches outlined with blue.
The prickly leather-jacket has two erectile dorsal spines.
Its dorsal, anal and caudal fin are translucent but only the rays are a bit darker and visible.

The prickly leather-jacket mainly feeds on algaes and small marine invertebrates.

The prickly leather-jacket is solitary and has a diurnal activity.

Balistes punctatus, the bluespotted triggerfish or simply spotted triggerfish, is a species of triggerfish from the Eastern Atlantic. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade.[1] It can grow to a size of 60 centimetres (24 in) total length but typically is much smaller.[2]

The bluespotted triggerfish is known to not do well with other species within the same family when kept in an aquarium. If other specimens are in the tank with it, the aquarium should be of large size to avoid aggressive and malicious behavior. This species is not only naturally aggressive in its behavior, but it is also curious and known to explore.[3] Another common name for the bluespotted triggerfish is the Golden Heart Triggerfish.[4]

The bluespotted triggerfish known to be a carnivore.[4]  It is recorded to eat a variety of food that include:

The bluespotted triggerfish occurs in the Eastern Atlantic from Morocco to Angola, including Madeira, the Canary Islands, and Cape Verde.[1][2]

The Clarion angelfish (Holacanthus clarionensis) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean, almost exclusively near islands off the Pacific coast of Mexico.[3]

The Clarion angelfish has a laterally compressed, quadrilateral body.[4] It has a small mouth which is equipped with bristle like teeth.[5] The juveniles have an overall colour of yellowish-orange on the body and fins; the body is marked with a number of blue vertical bars which fade and, eventually, disappear as the fish matures. The juveniles may also have blue lips and blue margins on the dorsal and anal fins. The adults have a brownish face, with the adjacent part of the body behind reddish orange and the posterior body being browner. The dorsal and anal fins are bright orange while the caudal fin is vermilion. [6] The dorsal fin contains 14 spines and 17-19 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 19-19 soft rays.[5] This species attains a maximum total length of 20 centimetres (7.9 in).[3]

The Clarion angelfish has a very limited range in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, being largely restricted to the Revillagigedo Islands of Mexico. Vagrants have occasionally been reported from the southern tip of Baja California and the southeastern part of the Gulf of California, as well as Clipperton Island, a French territory.[1]

The Clarion angelfish is found in rocky reefs at depths of up to 30 metres (98 ft). They are typically encountered as either solitary individuals or in shoals. It is a little studied species.[4]

The Clarion angelfish was first formally described in 1890 by the American ichthyologist Charles Henry Gilbert (1859-1928), with the type locality given as Clarion, Socorro and San Benedicto Islands in the Revillagigedo Islands, western Mexico.[7] The specific name refers to Clarion Island.[8]

The Clarion angelfish was formerly collected for the aquarium trade, but since the Revillagigedo Islands were declared a protected area collection has been illegal.[1] It has, however, been bred in captivity and captive bred specimens have entered the trade.[9]

The longnose hawkfish (Oxycirrhites typus) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a hawkfish belonging to the family Cirrhitidae. It is found on tropical reefs of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, where it can be found at depths around 10 to 100 m (33 to 328 ft).  It prefers the steep outer slopes of the reefs amongst gorgonians and black corals.  This species can reach 13 cm (5.1 in) in total length.  It can also be found in the aquarium trade.  It is currently the only known member in its genus.[2]

The longnose hawkfish was first formally described in 1857 by the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker with the type locality given as Ambon Island in Indonesia.[3] Bleeker placed it in the monotypic genus Oxycirrhites.[4] The genus name is a compound of oxy meaning “sharp” or ""pointed"" and Cirrhites, an alternative spelling of the type genus of the family Cirrhitidae, Cirrhitus. The specific name typus  denotes that it is the type species of its genus.[5]

The longnose hawkfish differs from all the other hawkfish species in its elongated snout, the length of the snout fitting roughly twice into the overall length of the head. The canine teeth in the jaws are of uniform size and are only slightly larger than the inner band of villiform teeth.[6] The dorsal fin contains 10 spines and 13 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7 soft rays. This fish reaches a maximum total length of 13 centimetres (5.1 in).[7] There is a tuft of cirri at the tip of each dorsal fin spine.[8] The overall colour of the body is whitish overlain with a grid of red horizaontal and vertical lines.[9]

The longnose hawkfish has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution. In the Indian Ocean it is found from the Red Sea, along the coast of east Africa south to northern Mozambique and Madagascar across the Indian Ocean into the Pacific where it reaches as far east as the Hawaiian Islands and the Society Islands in French Polynesia north to Japan and south to Australia.[1] In Australia it occurs from south west of Barrow Island and at the Scott Reef in Western Australia, the Ashmore Reef in the Timor Sea and from Lizard Island south to Escape Reef in Queensland, as well as occurring at Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. In the eastern Pacific Ocean it is found from the southern tip of Baja California and the central Gulf of California south to Colombia, and at the Revillagigedos, Galapagos, Cocos and Malpelo.[10] It occurs at depths between 10 and 100 m (33 and 328 ft).[1] It is found on steep outer reef slopes which are exposed to strong currents, living among large gorgonians and black corals.[7]

The longnose hawkfish preys on small benthic or planktonic crustaceans. It is uncommon to rare in most of its range and it is a territorial species. They are pelagic spawners which form distinct monogamous pairs to breed.[7]

The longnose hawkfish is common in the aquarium trade.[11]

The humpback grouper (Cromileptes altivelis), panther grouper, or (in Australia) barramundi cod is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a grouper from the subfamily Epinephelinae which is in the family Serranidae which also includes the anthias and sea basses. It occurs in the Western Pacific Ocean.

The humpback grouper was first formally described as Serranus altivelis in 1828 by the French zoologist Achille Valenciennes (1794-1865) with the type locality given as Java.[4] In 1839, the English naturalist William John Swainson (1789-1855) placed it in the subgenus Chromileptes, which was later created as a monotypic genus.[2] Swainson spelt the genus as Chromileptes[5] although Fishbase spells it as Cromileptes.[3] Recent molecular analyses based on five genes show that Cromileptes altivelis is included in the same clade as species of Epinephelus. Consequently, the species should be included in Epinephelus as Epinephelus altivelis.[6]

The humpback grouper is a medium-sized fish which grows up to 70 cm (28 in).[7]
Its particular body shape makes this grouper quite impossible to mix up with other fishes. Its body is compressed laterally and is relatively high. This stocky and strange visual effect is accented by its concave profile and its elongated snout which gives it a humpbacked appearance.

The young have a white background with round black spots and are continuously swimming head down. The adults have a body colouration with variances of grey and beige with darker blotches variable in size on the body. Small black spots cover the whole body.

It is widely distributed throughout the tropical waters of the central Indo-West Pacific region.[7] The humpback grouper lives in clear waters from lagoons and seaward reefs with a preference for dead or silty areas. They are found in a range of depth from 2 to 40 m (6.6 to 131.2 ft).[3]

In 2012, a single individual was speared in the waters off South Florida, raising fears that it could become invasive, similar to the lionfish.[8]

The diet of this grouper is based on small fishes and crustaceans.[3] Like the members of its family, the humpback grouper is demersal, solitary (except during mating periods), defends a territory, and is an ambush predator. Its feeding activity is maximal at sunrise and/or at sunset. This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite; in other words, all individuals are born female, with the ability to transform to males as they grow older. Typically, only the most dominant, mature females undergo this transformation in the absence of a dominant male.

The humpback grouper has been give Data Deficient status by the IUCN. It is a highly valued food fish, especially in Southeast Asia and in this region it is overexploited. It is bred in aquaculture but there is no evidence that captive breeding has reduced the fishing pressure on wild populations. There is little data on the populations but it is suspected that the population have declined historically and that they continue to do so. Australia has put strong conservation measures in place for this species (no take species in Queensland and possession limits in other states, e.g. Western Australia) but it is lacking protection elsewhere.[1]

This grouper is kept in marine aquaria.[9]

The twospot cardinalfish (Apogon pseudomaculatus) is a species of fish in the family Apogonidae. It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from southern Georgia to Sao Paulo, Brazil. A lionfish caught off Onslow Bay, North Carolina  had a twospot cardinalfish in its gut contents and records from as far north as New England are most likely to be vagrants. It is also found in the eastern Atlantic from the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe in the Gulf of Guinea and Ascension Island.[1] It is common on hard or semi-hard substrates of the continental shelf such as in harbours, around pilings and over sea walls and offshore to the outer reefs. It is a mouthbrooder.[2] It is active at night and feeds on plankton.[1]

Amblygobius phalaena, the Sleeper Banded goby, white-barred goby, is a species of goby native to tropical reefs of the western Pacific Ocean and through the central Indo-Pacific area at depths of from 2 to 20 metres (6.6 to 65.6 ft).  This species feeds by taking in mouthfuls of sand and sifting out algae, invertebrates and other organic matter.  It can reach a length of 15 centimetres (5.9 in) TL.  It is also of minor importance to local commercial fisheries and can also be found in the aquarium trade.[1]

The blue-spotted jawfish (Opistognathus rosenblatti) is a species of jawfish native to the Gulf of California.  It is an inhabitant of reefs where it is found in large colonies at depths of around 12 metres (39 ft).  This species hides in its burrow at night, completely sealing the entrance.  Every morning, it rebuilds the burrow entrance.  It can reach a length of 10 centimetres (3.9 in) TL.  It can also be found in the aquarium trade.[2]

The blue-spotted jawfish was first discovered in the Tropical Eastern Pacific by Gerald Allen and David R. Robertson in 1991.[2] They belong to the class of Actinopterygii.

The blue-spotted jawfish have an electric-blue spotting over a yellow or orange body with an elegant yellow dorsal fin. They have large eyes that make them look as ""alien"".[3]  The males have stark white in their anterior halves. The females and the non-courting males are dark brown and have larger blue spots. The younger jawfish are uniformly colored yellow with blue spots.

Jawfish are named for their large mouths, which allow them to catch food. Their large mouths also allow them to dig their burrows by taking big mouthfuls of sand and spitting them out in order to create their hideaways.[4]  Some jawfish consume worms, crustaceans, and invertebrates, but the blue-spotted jawfish feeds on tiny animals: benthic and planktonic invertebrates. They are colonial species and can be found in quite large colonies.[5]

The blue-spotted jawfish are very social amongst other members of its own species. They are not aggressive except to those who try to enter their burrows. They are found in cold water at deeper depth of the ocean in sandy rubbles and reef areas. They live in colonies of up to several hundred fish, with a minimal spacing of 1 to 3 m (3.3 to 9.8 ft) between individuals. They cover their burrow entrance at dusk and rebuild the opening every morning. Unlike the Opistognathus aurifrons, the blue-spotted jawfish only spend time out and above their burrows during the warm summer season.[2]

There are two diseases that can affect the blue-spotted jawfish. First of all, the Brooklynellosis and blue-spotted jawfish disease.[6] When the blue-spotted jawfish are affected by the Brooklynella, it is likely that they will deteriorate and die within approximately 24 hours. The symptoms of Brooklynellosis include: peeling skin and color loss all over the body, or no appetite. They may leave their burrow and list around until they eventually die.

Edit: Brookynella is easily treated in a quarantine tank using malachite green in combination with formalin.

The so-called ""Blue spot jawfish disease"" is almost always damage to the fish caused by; rough handling, coarse or abrasive substrate, being kept on bare glass, or, from being kept at above 21c.

Jawfish are mouth brooders, they utilize their mouth to hold the eggs until they reach the hatching point. They incubate the eggs in their mouths for about 5 to 7 days.  In addition, males display behaviorally and color-wise in the summer months by becoming bright white, dashing 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22 m) above their burrow, trying to attract the females. If the male is successful attracting the female, then the female join his tube for a few minutes after returning in hers.[2]

The specific name honours Richard H. Rosenblatt (1930-2014), an ichthyologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who made many contributions to the study of the fishes of the eastern Pacific.[7]

红面古b,Elacatinus puncticulatus,红脑霓虹鰕虎,鲈形目,"

Elacatinus puncticulatus is a species of goby from the eastern central Pacific Ocean, where it is found on reefs from the Gulf of California to Ecuador.  This species occurs at depths ranging from 1 to 21m, and usually in association with the sea urchin Eucidaris thouarsii. The size of the goby varies depending on sex, with females being typically smaller than males, and their geographical location as well as their role as a cleaner goby also has impacts on their morphology.[2] Due to their bright coloration and lack of aggression, the species is commonly found in the aquarium trade.[3][4]

Elacatinus puncticulatus is a member of the family Gobiidae, which is broken up into two genera: Elacatinus and Gobiosoma. Elacatinus is a genus of goby fish comprising 25 species with characteristic 7 spines, 28 vertebrae, compressed skull shape, and transparent fins. E. puncticulatus are the only species in the genus that display a lack of scales on the head and body.[4] The E. puncticulatus species in particular is characterized by the strong red and blue coloration on its head, with yellow and black striped coloration on its body, and a dark horizontal stripe behind its eye.[5] The blue stripe near the head of many Elacatinus species is often seen as an adaptation that allows the fish to effectively attract clients that they clean as a part of their role as a symbiotic cleaner species.[2] The species is sometimes broken up into two clades, with subclades within those, based on interspecific variations seen in both their coloration and genetics. Those variations are believed to have been a result of oceanographic processes and habitat discontinuities that separated different E. puncticulatus groups over time. Depending on their location, different members of the species display different colors on their head, body, and eye stripes, which can range from red to more of a yellow-orange.[6]

Their general size differs depending on sex, with males reaching around 30-40mm in length while females only reach around 22-27mm and this size difference between the sexes increases as general latitude increases.[4] Besides just geographic location, their role as a cleaner goby also has an impact on their morphology. Elacatinus as a genus typically displays a terminal mouth position that corresponds to their roles as cleaner fish, but E. puncticulatus specifically display a heterodont dentition as well, meaning they have more than one type of tooth morphology. This differentiates them from other cleaner species in their genus, but is characteristic of their role as an occasional, or facultative, cleaner (as compared to dedicated, or obligate, cleaners).[2]

E. puncticulatus are a shallow-living goby found along the continental shore of the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), which ranges from the Southern tip of the California peninsula to the South of Ecuador. Specifically within this area, the species live primarily between the subtidal zone and depths of 21m on rocky or coral reefs.[4][5][6] Their habitat on coral reefs, considered “cleaning stations”, which combined with the bright blue coloration on parts of their head allows the species to attract clients and feed off of the removed ectoparasites.[2] They are the only species of the genus Elacatinus not found in the Atlantic, and only one of two species in the genus found in the TEP.  Their distribution is shaped by habitat discontinuities that restrict their dispersal in the area, one of the most notable examples being two muddy sections of shore within the TEP.[6]

Elacatinus puncticulatus display active courtship before spawning and parental behaviors after spawning. Males of E. puncticulatus show a gray head and yellow and black body coloration instead of their usual red and blue head coloration. One day prior to spawning, males move their pectoral fins to promote burrow cleanliness and display heavy breathing to signify readiness. Females of E. puncticulatus display strong red and black colors, but become pale three days before spawning. The male knows the female is ready to spawn because her urogenital region turns from brown to red the day prior to spawning.[5] The genus Elacatinus are primarily gonochoristic, do not change sex, and often maintain stable monogamous relationships throughout their life.[7]

E. puncticulatus produce benthic eggs that give rise to pelagic larvae.[6] Male E. puncticulatus clean the dead eggs after hatching, but sometimes they will clean the eggs before hatching, which leads to a loss of up to 50% of the eggs.[5] E. puncticulatus produce around 150 eggs per spawn, but only about 100 will actually hatch and produce pelagic larvae. The eggs range in size from 0.4 to 0.7mm. A heartbeat can be detected at 120 hours post fertilization (5 days) when they grow most rapidly and have the highest mortality. Spontaneous hatching takes about an hour and a half to complete and occurs 168 hours after fertilization (7 days). The incubation and embryonic development stages of E. puncticulatus are similar to those of Elacatinus figaro.[5] There is a lot unknown about E. puncticulatus larval stage including distribution and time spent in the pelagic larval stage, but similar Elacatinus species have a range of 21–38 days.[6]

Elacatinus puncticulatus are found in corals in the continental shelf of the TEP. They often live in association with sea urchins, although the reason for this is undetermined.[6] The Elacatinus genus feeds primarily on ectoparasites from cleaning and cellular fish debris, and E. puncticulatus seem to be no different.[5] Both males and females clean. Cleaning gobies can display cheating behavior when cleaning with a partner, where they consume scales and mucus from the clients instead of just ectoparasites, although this is uncommon in the Elacatinus genus. When cleaning with the opposite sex, males tend to modify behavior to be more cooperative and females tend to stay the same.[7] Clients of this cleaning mutualism are either non-predatory fish like parrotfishes,[8] or piscivorous fish that are potential predators for the goby, like longfin damselfish,[9] yellowtail damselfish,[10] and graysby grouper.[11] While some clients are predatory to E. puncticulatus and other cleaner gobies, the predatory clients are often immediately cleaned upon arrival, which could help their identification as a cleaner and reduce the risk of predation.[9] The immediate cleaning of those predator clients may reduce the risk of predation, but it does not provide any foraging advantage since predator clients and non-predator clients offer the same amount of ectoparasites, and predatory clients often decrease the visits made by the more abundant non-predatory clients.[9][8]

The 25 species of Elacatinus are considered ""neon gobies"" due to their brightly colored appearance and the variety of coloration they display. Along with their attractive appearance, their ability to become domesticated rather easily as well as their relatively calm disposition make them more appealing to those involved in the aquarium trade of marine fish and coral. As a result of this, many of the species, including the bright red and blue E. puncticulatus are kept for ornamental purposes in many different regions.[5]

Elacatinus puncticulatus is commonly found in the aquarium trade industry, because new technologies have made it easier to manage captive marine species.[5] The United States Fish and Wildlife Service CITES program requires certain species to be named specifically when trading, but E. puncticulatus is not on the list.[12] E. puncticulatus is referred to as marine tropical fish in reports. It can be difficult for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to regulate their trade and study their endangerment status.[12]

The Clipperton angelfish (Holacanthus limbaughi) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is endemic to Clipperton Island, a French possession in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

The Clipperton angelfish has a deep, laterally compressed body. It has a small mouth that has bristle-like teeth. The preoperculum has a sizeable spine at its corner and a serrated rear margin while there are 4 spines between the preoperculum and the operculum.[3] The juveniles are a dark bluish-grey on their bodies, which is marked with a number of vertical blue bars, 2 on the head and 5 on the flanks, these fade as they mature into adults.[4] They also have a white spot on the upper side and white caudal and pectoral fins. The adults are similar, lacking the barring, and have vivid blue margins to the dorsal, anal and pelvic fins. The dorsal fin contains 14 spines and 17-18 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 17-18 soft rays.[3] This species attains a maximum total length of 30 centimetres (12 in).[5]

The Clipperton angelfish is endemic to the waters of the French overseas territory of Clipperton Island, which is 2,560 kilometres (1,590 mi) west of Costa Rica, in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.[5]

The Clipperton angelfish is found at depths between 6 and 100 metres (20 and 328 ft). Very little is known about its habitat preferences and biology.[1]

The Clipperton angelfish was first formally described in 1963 by the American ichthyologist Wayne J. Baldwin.[6] The specific name honours the American scuba diver, zoologist and underwater photographer Conrad Limbaugh (1925–1960) who played a vital role in the collection of the type.[7]

The Clipperton angelfish has such a remote and restricted distribution that it is extremely scarce in the aquarium trade. When it has appeared in that trade it has commanded very high prices.[1] In 2009, a California tropical fish dealer was caught trying to bring 52 illegally collected Clipperton angelfish into the United States, falsely declaring them as king angelfish to federal wildlife authorities.[8] He intended to sell the fish for $10,000 each.[9]

Holacanthus septentrionalis Temminck & Schlegel, 1844

Chaetodontoplus septentrionalis, the blue-striped angelfish and bluelined angelfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae.[2] it is found in the Western Pacific Ocean.

Chaetodontoplus septentrionalis has a background body colour of yellow to tan overlain with vivid longitudinal blue stripes and a yellow caudal fin. In the females the blue stripes run the length of the body. In the males the lines on the body are duller and they have blue lines on the face. 
[4] The juveniles have a black background colour and there are yellow markings on their fins and a yellow bar to the rear of the head.[5]

Chaetodontoplus septentrionalis occurs in the western Pacific Ocean from southern Japan and South Korea and Taiwan and southern China.[1]

Chaetodontoplus septentrionalis is commonest on rocky reefs which have large boulders and stones, as well as rubble slopes. It is found at depths of 2 to 30 metres (6.6 to 98.4 ft). Small juveniles are frequently commoner at depths over 15 metres (49 ft) down to 30 metres (98 ft) they are found on rocky, patch reefs and frequently stay close to a crevice where they can shelter if required.[5] It feeds on sponges and tunicates.[3] Like all other angelfish it is a protogynous hermaphrodite, with all individuals being female initially and the dominant ones changing to males.[6]

Chaetodontoplus septentrionalis was first formally described in 1844 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Hermann Schlegel with the type locality given as Nagasaki.[7] The specific name means northern, thought to be a reference to its more northerly distribution than apparently related species.[8]

Chaetondontoplus septentrionalis is infrequently traded in the aquarium trade but when it does appear it often thrives in captivity.[1]

The peppermint angelfish (Centropyge boylei) is a relatively small species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is found in the Central area of the South Pacific Ocean, and is known to be native to the Cook Islands.

The peppermint angelfish has a deep, oval shaped body which has five white vertical bands on a reddish-orange background. The dorsal and anal fins have white margins and the caudal fin is translucent. The face and chin are white.[2][3] This species attains a maximum total length of 7 centimetres (2.8 in).[4]

The peppermint angelfish is found in the eastern central Pacific Ocean. It has only been recorded from Rarotonga in the Cook Islands, although it is considered likely that it will be recorded elsewhere in the region.[1]

The peppermint angelfish is found at depths of 55 to 120 metres (180 to 394 ft) on areas of coral rubble, overhangs and caves situated in the steep outer slopes of reefs.[1] It is little known but its diet is thought to be made up of worms, crustaceans, sponges, tunicates, and detritus.[3] It has been recorded in pairs or small groups.[1]

The peppermint angelfish was first formally described in 1992 by John Ernest Randall (1924–2020) and Richard Pyle.[5] It is placed in the subgenus Paracentropyge by some authorities. Its specific name honours the collector of the type, Charles “Chip” J. Boyle.[6]

The peppermint angelfish is occasionally exported as an aquarium specimen and can fetch high prices (a single specimen was offered to be bought for $30,000).[7]

史密夫蝶,Chaetodon smithi,史氏蝴蝶鱼,鲈形目,"

Smith's butterflyfish (Chaetodon smithi) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a butterflyfish belonging to the family Chaetodontidae. This species is endemic to the south western Pacific Ocean.

Smith's butterflyfish has the anterior half of the body and associated fins are dark brown while the posterior half and fins are yellow. The posterior soft rayed part of the dorsal fin and the anal fin have blue margins.[2] It attains a maximum total length of 18 centimetres (7.1 in).[3] The separation of the two colour blocs on the body is irregular and the spines of the dorsal fin are also yellow over the brown anterior part of the body.[4] It attains a maximum total length of 19 centimetres (7.5 in).[3]

Smith's butterflyfish is endemic to the south western Pacific Ocean where it has only been recorded from the British Overseas Territory of Pitcairn Island and Rapa Iti and Marotiri, the Ilots de Basse, in French Polynesia.[3] There has been a single confirmed record from Easter Island.[4]

Smith's butterflyfish occur on rocky reefs with dense growth of algae and at least a little coral. It is often encountered in large aggregations in the middle of the water column where they feed on zooplankton.[1] This oviparous species forms pairs for breeding.[3]

This species was described in 1975 by the American ichthyologist John Ernest Randall (1924-2020) with the type locality given as off Young's Rock, Pitcairn Island.[5] The type specimens were collected by the ichthyologist C. Lavett Smith, Jr. (1927-2015) of the American Museum of Natural History and whom Randall honoured with its specific name.[6]

This species does appear in the aquarium trade[2] but is extremely rare in that trade.[1] It is on display at the Waikiki Aquarium.[4]

暗带蝶,Chaetodon nippon,日本蝴蝶鱼,鲈形目,"

Chaetodon nippon, also known as the Japanese butterflyfish, is a species of butterflyfish found in the northwest Pacific Ocean in the shallow seas around Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan.

The Japanese butterflyfish is a deep-bodied, vertically flattened fish up to 15 cm (6 in) long. The dorsal fin has 12 or 13 spines and 18 to 20 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 15 or 16 soft rays. The body is creamy-brown, rimmed with dark brown. The juvenile fish has an eyespot in the region of its soft dorsal fin, but this fades as it grows.[4][3]

The Japanese butterflyfish is native to the northwestern Pacific Ocean, where it occurs in the waters of Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan. It is particularly common around the Izu Islands.[1] With a preference for rocky coastal reef habitats, it has been recorded at depths of between 5 and 20 metres (16 and 66 ft), although it is probable that it also inhabits deeper water.[1]

The Japanese butterflyfish is a benthic fish with an omnivorous diet,[5] which includes polychaete worms, crabs and other small invertebrates. It often moves around in large or small groups.[1]

Although many butterflyfish form aggregations when spawning, the Japanese butterflyfish have been observed spawning in pairs.[6] This is one of the few species of butterflyfish whose larval development has been studied. On hatching, the larvae float upside down near the surface, but at 72 hours start swimming and feed on such zooplankton as oyster larvae. By the time they are ready to settle, the butterflyfish larvae are attracted to lights at night, and at this time, their colouring transforms into that of juvenile fish with great rapidity.[7]

This fish has a fairly wide distribution and is a common species, particularly in the Izu Islands. It seldom appears in the aquarium trade and its population seems stable, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of ""least concern"".[1]

蓝线蝶,Chaetodon fremblii,蓝纹蝴蝶鱼,鲈形目,"

The bluestripe butterflyfish or blue-striped butterflyfish (Chaetodon fremblii) is a species of butterflyfish (family Chaetodontidae) found in the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands. The fish is endemic to Hawaii where it is common on shallow water reefs.

The bluestripe butterflyfish, like other butterflyfish, are laterally flattened fish up to 15 cm (6 in) long with pointed snouts and rectangular bodies. The dorsal fin has 12 to 14 spines and 20 to 21 soft rays, while the anal fin has 3 spines and 16 to 18 soft rays. The bluestripe butterflyfish has eight distinctive diagonal blue stripes radiating from the eye region, on a yellow background. There is a black spot at the top of the head and another larger spot of black at the base of the tail. This latter dark patch may serve to distract predators by encouraging them to attack the tail rather than the head end.[2][3]

The bluestripe butterflyfish is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands where it is described as being abundant on coral and rocky reefs down to depths of about 28 m (90 ft).[1]

The bluestripe butterflyfish is an omnivore, unlike some butterflyfishes which feed almost exclusively on corals. These specialists usually have mating systems involving a pair bond, but the omnivorous bluestripe butterflyfish lives in a more resource-rich environment, where it is easier to find sufficient food. As a result, males of this species operate a harem system, defending a territory which includes up to four smaller female territories.[4]

The bluestripe butterflyfish was first formally described in 1828 by the English naturalist Edward Turner Bennett (1797-1836).[5] The specific name honours Lieutenant John Frembly R.N., a marine surveyor and geologist, who presented a collection of fish specimens from the Sandwich Islands to the Zoological Society of London.[6]

The bluestripe butterflyfish is sometimes kept in reef aquaria where its generalised diet means that it is easier to maintain than corallivorous types. Specimens are harvested from the wild and it is sometimes difficult to get the fish to eat in captivity. In this respect, juveniles within two or three months of settling are more willing to accept prepared and novel foods. Attempts have been made to breed the fish in captivity, but the lengthy larval period of about two months in the open ocean is difficult to replicate in captivity.[7]

西澳黑毕毕,Chelmon muelleri,黑鳍钻嘴鱼,鲈形目,"

Chelmon muelleri, the blackfin coralfish or Muller's coralfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a butterflyfish in the family Chaetodontidae. It is a reef fish which is endemic to Australia.[2]

Chelmon muelleri is a long-snouted species of butterflyfish which has a silvery white background colour to the body, marked with four wide brown vertical bars and a large black ocellus at the base of the posterior dorsal fin.[3][4] The dorsal fin contains 9-10 spines and 26-30 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 18-21 soft rays. This species attains a total length of 20.5 centimetres (8.1 in).[2]

Chelmon muelleri is endemic to Australia from the Kimberley Island groups in Western Australia to the southern Great Barrier Reef in Queensland.[3]

Chelmon muelleri is found on shallow coastal reefs with very little cover of live coral, where the seabed consists of mud or silt or there is extensive  cover of algae. It also occurs in estuaries.[1] It can be found as deep as 20 metres (66 ft).[3] The adult fish are normally observed in  pairs, although juveniles are solitary. It is a carnivorous species which has a diet consisting of worms, clams, tunicates, and crustaceans.[5]

Chelmon muelleri was first formally described in 1879 by the German zoologist Carl Benjamin Klunzinger (1834-1914)[6] with the type locality given as Port Denison in Queensland.[3] The specific name honours the German physician, geographer and botanist Ferdinand von Mueller (1825-1896).[7]

Chelmon muelleri rarely appears in the aquarium trade and when it does it commands high prices.[4]
"
红海骑士,Acanthurus sohal,红海刺尾鱼,鲈形目,"

The sohal surgeonfish (Acanthurus sohal) or sohal tang, is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Acanthuridae, which includes the surgeonfishes, unicornfishes and tangs. This fish is found in the northwestern Indian Ocean.

The sohal surgeonfish was first formally described in 1775 as Chaetodon sohal by the Swedish-speaking Finnish naturalist, explorer and orientalist Peter Forsskål with its type locality given as  the Red Sea.[4] Forsskål proposed Acanthuirus as a subgenus of Chaetodon although he recognised that it was probably different from Chaetodon even at the family level. In 1856 Desmarest designated Teuthis hepatus, which had been described from a type now known to have been collected at Ambon Island in the Moluccas (other erroneous type localities were named) in 1758 by Linnaeus, as the type species of the genus.[5][4] T. hepatus is a synonym of Paracanthurus hepatus and this would make Paracanthurus synonymous with Acanthurus. An alternative would be to use the name Harpurus proposed as a monospecific genus in 1788 by Johann Reinhold Forster when he described Harpurus fasciatus, a synonym of Acanthurus triostegus. It has been proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature should be petitioned to stabilise the genera Acanthurus and Paracanthurus.[6] In 2014 it was proposed that the type species of Acanthurus should be C. sohal, which had also been described by Forsskål in 1775 as a member of the subgenus alongside C. bifasciatus, C. nigrofuscus and C. unicornis, and had been designated as the type species by Jordan and Evermann in 1917.[7] The genus Acanthurus is one of two genera in the tribe Acanthurini which is one of three tribes in the subfamily Acanthurinae which is one of two subfamilies in the family Acanthuridae.[8]

The sohal surgeonfish's specific name, sohal, is the Arabic name for this species along the Red Sea coast.[9]

The sohal surgeonfish has its dorsal fin supported by 9 spines and 30 or 31 soft rays while the anal fin is supported by 3 spines and 28 or 29, typically 29, soft rays. The depth of the body is around half the standard length. This fish has longitudinal, thin black stripes separated by greenish olive stripes and these join together at the spine on the caudal peduncle. The stripes are finer and more sinuous on the upper body but broader and straighter on the lower body. The stripes are greyer on the upper head and nape. The lower head and ventral surface of the body are pale with faint grey and greenish grey longitudinal lines> the dorsal, anal and pelvic fins are black with vivid blue margins, there is a large patch of orange on the body underneath the pectoral fin and the sheath of the spine on the caudal peduncle is orange. The caudal fin is lunate.[10] This species has a maximum published total length of 40 cm (16 in).[3]

The sohal surgeonfish is endemic to the northwestern Indian Ocean where it is found in the Red Sea, east along the coast of the Arabian Peninsula to the Persian Gulf.[1] It has been found in the Mediterranean Sea, in 2017 and 2018, and reached there either by release from an aquarium or by Lessepsian migration through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea.[11] It is usually found on the outer edges of fringing reefs that are exposed to surge, typically down to depths of around 20 m (66 ft).[10]

The sohal surgeonfish may be encountered either singly or in small schools and is known to be very territorial. The spine on the caudal peduncle has been reported to bear venom.[10] It grazes on algae growing on hard substrates and despite being solitary they will school to graze in the territories of other fishes. The territory guards food resources and the territory holder may shelter and otherwise spend a lot of time out of its territory or patrolling its boundaries.[1]

The sohal surgeonfish is targeted by fisheries as a food fish and is also traded in the aquarium trade.[1]

Cirrhilabrus condei are fairy wrasse which is also known as Conde's wrasse.[2] They originate from the shallow rubble flats of Melanesia. The Conde's fairy wrasse is very peaceful; they are red alone black with a white belly.[3] Female Conde's wrasse are red with a pale stripe along the lower rear, a black dorsal fin, a pale stripe with a white lower body, and a red anal fin. Males are similar with more intense coloration.[4] The life cycle and mating behavior of Cirrhilabrus condei distinct pairing during breeding.[5] Unlike other wrasses, they raise the front 2/3 of their dorsal fins and sometimes colors may vary depending on the fish's mood, breeding timeframe, and age of the specimen.[6] [7]

This species reaches a length of 8.0 cm (3.1 in).[8]

The fish is named in honor of zoologist Bruno Condé (fr) (1920–2004), the director of l'Aquarium de Nancy, because of his service as the editor of Revue française d'Aquariologie, the journal in which the description appeared, and for his contributions to the aquarium field.[9]

夏威夷番茄（雀鲷科）,Amphiprion nigripes,浅色双锯鱼,鲈形目,"

Amphiprion nigripes (Maldive anemonefish or blackfinned anemonefish), is a marine fish belonging to the family Pomacentridae, which includes clownfishes and damselfishes.[3]

The Maldive anemonefish is a small fish which grows up to 11 cm as a female and 8 cm as a male.[4]  It is oval-bodied and laterally compressed.[5]


This clownfish is characterized by its rusty orange color with a single white stripe running vertically just behind the eye.  It has black pelvic and anal fins (hence the common name) and a variable area on its belly can be more or less black. Depending on geographic location, some fishes can be orangeish-yellow with an anal fin which is not black but the same color as the body.[6] 
The Maldive anemonefish is found in the western Indian Ocean in the Maldive Islands, Laccadive Islands, and Sri Lanka.[3][4]

This species typically lives in small groups on outer reef slopes at depths of 2–25 m (6 ft 7 in – 82 ft 0 in). It is particularly associated with the magnificent sea anemone.[3]

This anemonefish is omnivorous, and its diet is based on zooplankton, small benthic crustaceans, and algae.[4][7]

Amphiprion nigripes is active during the day. It is a protandrous hermaphrodite, which means  all fish are hatched as males and later can change sex to female. The males live in harems in which an established dominance hierarchy manages the group and keeps individuals at a specific social rank.
It also aggressively defends its territory and is completely dependent on its sea anemone, which represents its ""life insurance"" as a safe shelter for the group and for the nest.
The associative relationship that binds the clownfish and the sea anemone is called mutualism. The fish lives within the sea anemone's tentacles and can use it as a shelter because it has developed a thin layer of mucus which covers its body as a protection against the anemone's stinging tentacles, and the presence of the clownfish can be interpreted as a lure to attract potential anemone prey close to its tentacles; the clownfish can also defend the anemone against some reef fishes which could eat the tentacles, such as butterflyfish.[7]


In a tank, the species can eat brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, and chopped shellfish provided by a hobbyist.[4] Individuals that are tank-raised have accepted high-protein flakes as well as granular foods. The maldive anemonefish is considered mostly peaceful in an aquarium, with some aggression when defending its host. It has successfully been raised in captivity.[4]"
罗德豪小丑,Amphiprion mccullochi,麦氏双锯鱼,鲈形目,"

Amphiprion mccullochi, also known as whitesnout anemonefish or McCulloch's anemonefish, is a species of anemonefish found in subtropical waters at Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island.[2]. It was named for Allan McCulloch, a former Curator of Fishes at the Australian Museum, Sydney.[3] Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict sized based dominance hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends.[4] They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding male.[2]

A. mccullochi is dark brown with a pale snout, a white bar on each side of the head (but not connected on top of the head) and a pale tail. Juveniles have two white bars and the edge of the pectoral fins is yellow. They have 10 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 15-17 dorsal soft rays and 13-14 anal soft rays.[5] They reach a maximum length of 12 cm (4+3⁄4 in).[2]

Some anemonefish species have color variations based on geographic location, sex and host anemone. A. mccullochi does not show any of these variations.[2]

A. mccullochi is similar in appearance to A. melanopus which is distinguished by its reddish chest, belly and dorsal fin, with a yellowish to slightly red tail. The white bars are also connected over the top of the head.[2] Genetic analysis suggested evolutionary connectivity among samples of A. mccullochi and A. akindynos. Historical hybridization and introgression in the evolutionary past resulted in a complex mitochondrial DNA structure. There were two evolutionary groups with individuals of both species detected in both, thus the species lacked reciprocal monophyly.  There were no shared haplotypes between species.[6]

A. mccullochi is endemic to the south western Pacific Ocean at Lord Howe Island, Middleton Reef, Elizabeth Reef and Norfolk Island.[2]

The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is not random and instead is highly nested in structure.[7] A. mccullochi is highly specialised, being hosted with only 1 species of anemone: [2][7]

Anemonefish and their host anemones are found on coral reefs and face similar environmental issues. Like corals, anemone's contain intracellular endosymbionts, zooxanthellae, and can suffer from bleaching due to triggers such as increased water temperature or acidification.  Characteristics known to elevate the risk of extinction are small geographic range, small local population and extreme habitat specialisation.[8][9] The small geographic range, small local population and extreme habitat specialisation (it only associates with Entacmaea quadricolor) are all characteristics known to elevate the risk of extinction making A. mccullochi of particular conservation concern.[6] This species was not evaluated in the 2012 release of the IUCN Red List

The specific name honours Whitley's colleague, the Australian ichthyologist Allan Riverstone McCulloch (1885-1925) who collected the type specimen.[10]

This species has bred in captivity.[11][12]

澳洲黑豹小丑,Amphiprion latezonatus,宽带双锯鱼,鲈形目,"

Amphiprion latezonatus, also known as the wide-band anemonefish, is a species of anemonefish found in subtropical waters off the east coast of Australia.[2][3] Like all anemonefishes, it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of its host.  It is a sequential hermaphrodite  with a strict size-based dominance hierarchy; the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male nonbreeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends.[4] They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male changes to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest nonbreeder becoming the breeding male.[2]

A. latezonatus grows to 14 cm (5+1⁄2 in)[2][3] and is dark brown with three white bars and a broad white margin on the caudal fin. As the common name suggests, the middle bar is very wide, about twice the average width of other anemonefishes and is shaped like a flat-topped pyramid.[2] They have 10 dorsal spines, two anal spines,  15–16 dorsal soft rays, and 13–14 anal soft rays.[3]

A. latezonatus often has bright blue markings on the upper lip and the edges of the bars. The dorsal fin may be orange or yellow[2]

The broad midbody bar is distinctive, and A. latezonatus is unlikely to be confused with any other anemonefish.[2]  The closest in appearance are A. polymnus (saddleback anemonefish) and A. sebae (sebae anemonefish), but A. latezonatus has a broader midband and lacks the characteristic slope of A. polymnus or A. sebae.  Historically, anemonefish have been identified by morphological features and color pattern in the field, while in a laboratory, other features such as scalation of the head, tooth shape, and body proportions are used.[2] These features have been used to group species into complexes, and A. latezonatus was considered as part of the saddleback complex with A. polymnus and A. sebae.[5] Genetic analysis has shown that the saddleback complex is not a monophyletic group and that A. latezonatus has a monospecific lineage,[6] and is more closely related to A. percula and Premnas biaculeatus than to the saddleback group.[6][7]

A. latezonatus is found in subtropical waters of Australia, from southern Queensland to northern New South Wales, Norfolk Island, and Lord Howe Island.[2]

The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is not random and instead is highly nested in structure.[8] A. latezonatus is highly specialised with only one species anemone host, Heteractis crispa (sebae anemone).[2] A. latezonatus has been found in two additional host sea anemone species.[9]

Anemonefish and their host anemones are found on coral reefs and face similar environmental issues. Like corals, anemone's contain intracellular endosymbionts, zooxanthellae, and can suffer from bleaching due to triggers such as increased water temperature or acidification.  Characteristics known to elevate the risk of extinction are small geographic range, small local population, and extreme habitat specialisation.[10][11] A. latezonatus is an endemic species, confined to the subtropical east coast of Australia. The finding of A. latezonatus being hosted by two additional sea anemone species [9] may reduce the risk of extinction associated with specialisation.[12] This species was not evaluated in the 2012 release of the IUCN Red List

A. latezonatus has been bred in captivity.[13]

Neoglyphidodon polyacanthus is a species of damselfish of the family Pomacentridae. It is native to the western Pacific Ocean. This species of fish is found in the aquarium trade.

This species of fish is found in reefs in the western Pacific Ocean. Adults are found outside of lagoons while juvenile could be found in them.[1] They are found in areas of the western Pacific Ocean from the southern Great Barrier Reef in Australia and New Caledonia. In Lord Howe Island, they are found everywhere.[1] Neoglyphidodon polyacanthus is present at depths from 2 metres (6.6 ft) to 30 metres (98 ft).[2]

Adults can grow up to 12 centimetres (4.7 in).[1] The juvenile and adults of this species have different coloration. In adults, they have a grayish black coloration. Juveniles are yellow with blue lines extending from the eye to their eyespot. They lose their coloration as they mature.

This species of damselfish is found in the aquarium trade. In the aquarium, people feed them flake food, frozen food, and live food.[3][better source needed]

Tetradrachmum nitidum Whitley, 1928

The Barrier Reef chromis (Chromis nitida), also known as the yellowback puller or shining puller,[1] is a species of damselfish in the family Pomacentridae native to the east coast of Australia.  It is a small fish with a yellowish-brown dorsal surface separated by a dark stripe from its silvery flanks and underside.

The yellowback puller grows to a maximum length of about 9 cm (3.5 in). The single dorsal fin has thirteen spines and eleven to thirteen soft rays and the anal fin has two spines and ten or eleven soft rays. This fish has a dark diagonal line running from the eye to the posterior end of the dorsal fin. Above this line it is yellowish-brown and below it is silvery. The upper and lower edges of the deeply forked tail fin are black.[1][2]

The yellowback puller is native to the subtropical east coast of Australia. Its range extends from northern Queensland to southern New South Wales and includes Lord Howe Island. It is found at depths between 5 and 25 m (16 and 82 ft) on the outer side of coral-rich rocky reefs and in estuaries. Young fish sometimes inhabit lagoons, as do some adults.[1][2]

The yellowback puller is a shoaling species and often found in association with the black-axil chromis (Chromis atripectoralis).[3] It feeds on algae, zooplankton and small invertebrates. It forms pairs in the breeding season. The eggs are adhesive and stick to the seabed where the male guards them and keeps them aerated.[2]
The yellowback puller is sometimes parasitised by the isopod crustacean Anilocra pomacentri.[4] The size of the parasite and the fish seems to be correlated indicating that the manca (juvenile isopod) attaches at an early stage in the life of the fish and that both grow simultaneously.[4]

The yellowback puller is suitable to be kept in a reef aquarium where it can be fed on brine shrimps and mysid shrimps. Being a shoaling fish, it should be kept in a small group, and being non-aggressive, it mixes well with other species of fish.[3]

For species:

The stripey (Microcanthus strigatus), also known as the footballer or convict fish, is a species of ray-finned fish, a sea chub from the subfamily Microcanthinae which is part of the family Kyphosidae. It is native to the Pacific Ocean where it has a wide range. This species may be found in the aquarium trade.

The stripey was first formally described as Chaetodon strigatus in 1831 by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier with the type locality given as Nagasaki.[4] It was previously regarded as the only species in the genus Microcanthus, but as of 2020, a second species has been recognized.[5]

The stripey has a deep, compressed body which has a rounded back, it has a distinctive pattern of oblique black and yellow, sometimes white, stripes. The stripes extend onto the dorsal and anal fins, and there is a black stripe which runs from the forehead to just to the rear of the eye.[6][7] The maximum total length is 16 centimetres (6.3 in).[2]

The stripey is found in the Pacific Ocean where it has a disjunct distribution with a northern and a southern population. The northern population is found from Japan and Taiwan to Hawaii and the southern population is found along the east and west coasts of Australia, around Lord Howe Island and off New Caledonia.[1] The Australian distribution runs from central Queensland to southern New South Wales, although it may extend as far as eastern Victoria and the north east of Tasmania, and from Cape Leeuwin to the Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia.[6]

The stripey occurs in coastal and lagoon reefs where during the day it forms dense schools which hide under ledges and in caves. It feeds on small crustaceans and algae.[2] Juvenile stripets are often seen in tidal pools while the adults may be seen around man-made structures such as jetties and harbour walls.[6] They may enter brackish water.[8]

The stripey is occasionally found in the aquarium trade.[9]

Pomacanthus maculosus, the yellowbar angelfish, half-moon angelfish, yellow-marked angelfish, yellowband angelfish or yellow-blotched angelfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is found in the western Indian Ocean and, more recently, in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

Pomacanthus maculosus has a deep and compressed body with a small mouth that is equipped with small bristle-like teeth. They have an obvious spine at the angle of the preoperculum. The adults have filaments extending back from the soft-rayed parts of the dorsal and anal fins, reaching past the caudal fin. The background colour of adults is brownish blue with each scale having a blue margin creating the impression that it is predominantly blue. There is an uneven, yellow bar close to the centre of the flanks with dark blue, vertically elongated spots towards the head. The caudal fin has wavy, blue lines on a pale yellow background. The juveniles are mainly black marked with many, arced, vertical blue lines and three broader white lines. Only the rear third of the caudal fin is yellow.[3] The dorsal fin has 12–13 spines and 21 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 19–20 soft rays. This species attains a maximum total length of 50 cm (20 in).[2]

Pomacanthus maculosus is found in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman.[2] It has been recorded on distinct but rare occasions since 2008 in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.[4][5][6] It has also been recorded off Florida and Brazil, regarded as an instance of deliberate releases from an aquarium.[7]

Pomacanthus maculosus is found at depths of between 4 and 50 metres (13 and 164 ft).[1] It is a solitary species that lives in sheltered areas, often where there is a mixture of coral and silt.[3] Their diet is dominated by sponges and tunicates, although other invertebrates will be eaten opportunistically.[8] The females attain sexual maturity when the reach around 5.5 years of age and a total length of 21.6 cm (8.5 in). The maximum longevity is thought to be 36 years old. Divers have noted that this is a curious species and is not shy.[7] They are protogynous hermaphrodites and the older females can change sex to become males when there is a shortage of males. The larvae are planktonic.[8]

Pomacanthus maculosus was first formally described in 1775 as Chaetodon maculosus in 1775 by the Finnish born Swede Peter Forsskål (1732–1763) the type locality is given as Al-Luhayya in Yemen.[9] Some authorities place this species in the subgenus Arusetta. The specific name maculosus means “spotted” and a reference to either the blue spots on the scales or the large yellow blotch.[10]

Pomacanthus maculosus is occasionally collected for the aquarium trade. In some parts of the Persian Gulf it has been recorded in fish markets.[1]

Holacanthus duboulayi Günther, 1867

Chaetodontoplus duboulayi, the scribbled angelfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. This species is from the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

Chaetodontoplus duboulayi has an largely blue body marked with darker wavy lines. The snout is yellow as are the pectoral, pelvic and caudal fins. There is a yellow stripe which extends along the base of the dorsal fin and a wide vertical, yellow bar to the rear of the eye and the operculum is white. They are sexually dimorphic with the males being marked with sinuous blue lines along their flanks while the females have yellow or blue spots.[3] The dorsal fin contains 11 spines and 22 soft rays while the anal fin contains 3 spines and 21 soft rays. This species attains a maximum total length of 28 centimetres (11 in).[2]

Chaetodontoplus duboulayi Is found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean where it occurs along the northern Australian coast from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Moreton Bay in Queensland and as far south as Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea.[3] It can also be found in the Aru Islands of Indonesia and along the southern coast of New Guinea.[1] There have also been reports from Taiwan.[4]

Chaetodontoplus duboulayi at depths between 5 and 20 metres (16 and 66 ft)[1] and  is found on coastal and inshore reefs where there are areas of rubble, soft bottoms or open rocky areas which have a substrate made up of outcropping of rock, coral, sponge, and seawhips. They are normally encountered in small groups. They feed on benthic invertebrates especially sponges and tunicates.[2] Like all other angelfish it is a protogynous hermaphrodite, with all individuals being female initially and the dominant ones changing to males.[5]

In 1993, researchers at the Japanese Journal of Ichthyology began a study regarding the spawning behavior of Scribbled angelfish.[6] It was found that once laid, the eggs of Scribbled angelfish range from 0.92 millimeters to 0.9 millimeters.[6] Additionally, it was found that after spawning the number of eggs created can vary from 5,000 to 33,000.[6]

Chaetodontoplus duboulayi was first formally described in 1867 as Holocanthus duboulayi by the German-born British ichthyologist and herpetologist Albert Günther (1830–1914) with the type locality given as the northwestern coast of Australia.[7] The specific name honours the collector of the type, M. Duboulay, this is likely to be the collector, natural historian and entomologist Francis Houssemayne du Boulay (1837–1914).[8] anthough he specialised in Australian insects and beetles.

Chaetodontoplus duboulayi is a highly prized species in the aquarium trade[1] and formerly was only occasionally exported through that trade. More recently its availability has improved, although specimens still command high prices. They have now been successfully bred in captivity.[9]

蓝面神仙,Pomacanthus xanthometopon,黄颅刺盖鱼,鲈形目,"

Pomacanthus xanthometopon is a marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae found in shallow parts of the Indo-Pacific. It is commonly known as the  blueface angelfish or the yellowface angelfish because of its striking facial colouration.

Pomacanthus xanthometopon grows to a maximum length of 38 centimetres (15 in) and is laterally compressed. The mouth is just above the tip of the snout. The fins are large and rounded and are yellow, some edged with blue round the margins. The dorsal fin is set just in front of the caudal region, has a distinctive black eyespot at the base and has 13–14 spines and 16–18 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 16–18 soft rays. The scales are pale blue edged with yellow giving a reticulated pattern. The face is yellow with a dense network of brilliant blue lines on the bottom half and a plain yellow mask around the eyes. Juveniles are quite differently coloured with 6 vertical white bars separated by pale blue lines and a caudal fin barred in 2 shades of blue. The juveniles change colour gradually after reaching a length of 7 to 12 centimetres (2.8 to 4.7 in).[3][4] This species can be confused with the queen angelfish (Holacanthus ciliaris) or the blue angelfish (Holacanthus bermudensis), but both these have a completely blue face and lack the caudal eyespot.[4]

Pomacanthus xanthometopon is found on coral reefs in the eastern part of the tropical Indo-Pacific. Its range includes the Maldive Islands, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, northern Australia and Micronesia. It has occasionally been observed off the coast of Florida.[4] It favours lagoons, outer reef slopes and channels at depths down to about 25 metres (82 ft) and is often found among rocks and near caves. The juveniles frequently live inside caves.[3]

Pomacanthus xanthometopon usually lives singly or in pairs and feeds on tunicates, sponges, other encrusting organisms and algae.[4] It is an egg-laying species and scatters its eggs on the seabed.[5]

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species considers the yellowface angelfish of least concern because it is common over most of its wide range and has no major threats.[1]

Pomacanthus xanthometopon was first formally described in 1853 as Holocanthus xanthometopon by the Dutch ichthyologist and herpetologist Pieter Bleeker (1819-1878) with the type locality given as Telok betong, Sumatra in Indonesia.[6] The species is placed by some authorities in the subgenus Euxiphipops,. The specific name of this species, xantometopon means “yellow forehead”, a reference to the yellow “mask” across its eyes.[7]

Pomacanthus xanthometopon is uncommon in the aquarium trade, those specimens which make their way into that trade are usually traded through dealers in the Philippines and Singapore.[1]

Centropyge nahackyi, also called Nahacky's angelfish, is a small pygmy angelfish found on deeper drop-offs around Johnston Island and Hawaii.[2]

Centropyge nahackyi are known for their bright and vibrant colors which are highly valuable in aquarium trading.[3]

Centropyge nachackyi are characterized by their small mouth located in the front of their head. Its jaw teeth are slender, elongated, and broadly rounded, and positioned closely together. This allows them to have flexibility when it comes to jaw movements. Notably, there are no teeth on the roof of its mouth. Their tongues are short and rounded.[4] Centropyge nahackyi has a head profile that resembles a “bispinosa” complex, with the area above its eyes becoming more concave as it grows.[5] With a dark body, Centropyge nachackyi displays a blue and brown color on the back of its tail. It carries color patterns such as black and blue nape bars, yellow thorax, and a yellow tail base. Centropyge nahackyi stands apart visually from similar species due to consistent and noticeable differences.[5] These variations are from the gently sloping patterns that it possesses, giving this fish a unique appearance.[4]

Centropyge nahackyi are native to Johnston Atoll,[6] but from research around the Hawaiian Islands, scientists discovered a single specimen around the islands. This finding could be a waif discovery, or a stray occurrence of nahackyi.[4] Centropyge nachackyi is primarily found in environments with deep reefs that consist of eroded limestone. Centropyge nachackyi can be found in depths of 41–70 meters. They have a maximum abundance of 0.12 per meter squared.[5]

In the aquarium trade, due to its vibrant colors, Centropyge nachackyi can be sold for thousands of U.S dollars.[3]

Pomacanthodes zonipectus Gill, 1862

Pomacanthus zonipectus, the Cortez angelfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is from the Eastern Pacific. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade.

Pomacanthus zonipectus has a deep, compressed body with a short, blunt snout with a small mouth which has numerous small bristle-like teeth. It’s preoperculum has a large spine at its corner and a smooth vertical edge, while the area beneath the eye and the operculum have no spines.[3] Like other members of the genus Pomacanthus, has juveniles and adults which look quite different. The adults have the posterior half of the body covered by a matrix of crisscrossing lines, becoming yellowish-green in the tail. There is a large yellow arc to the rear of the pectoral fins and a bright yellow saddle across the nape.[4] There is a pale grey section in the middle of the flanks. The juveniles have a brownish black background colour broken by 6 vertical vivid yellow bands that start on the face and finish at the caudal peduncle,[5] between the yellow bars there are parallel blue bars.[3] The dorsal and pelvic fins have bright blue margins.[5] This species can reach a total body length of about 46 cm (18 in).[2] These angelfishes have 11 spines and 24-25 soft rays in the dorsal fin and 3 spines and 20-22 soft rays in the anal fin.[3]

Pomacanthus zonipectus occurs in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Puerto Peñasco,  in the northern Gulf of California of Mexico south to Peru. It has been recorded as a vagrant from  southern California, the Galapagos Islands,  Cocos Island and Malpelo Island, although it has not been reported from Clipperton Island.[1]

Pomacanthus zonipectus is found between depths of 6 and 50 m (20 and 164 ft).[1] This species is diurnal, it feeds on food items taken from the substrate, mainly sponges but including tunicates, algae, bryozoans, hydroids and the eggs of fish. The adults are found in pairs which range widely over therefore while the solitary juveniles are territorial. Spawning happens from midsummer to early autumn and the juveniles are most abundant from August up to November. They appear to be monogamous.[2] Juveniles are also found in tidal pools.[1]

Pomacanthus zonipectus was first formally described as Pomacanthodes zonipectus in 1862 by the American ichthyologist Theodore Nicholas Gill (1837–1914) with the type locality given as San Salvador in El Salvador.[6] Some authorities place this species in the subgenus Pomacanthus. The specific name zonipectus is a compound of zona meaning “belt” and pectus meaning “breast”, a reference to the dark-brown girdle on the breast to the rear of the pelvic and pectoral fins.[7]

Pomacanthus zonipectus occasionally appears in the aquarium trade.[1]

国王神仙,Holacanthus passer,雀点刺蝶鱼,鲈形目,"

Holacanthus passer (king angelfish or passer angelfish) is a large marine angelfish of the family Pomacanthidae.[2] Its large size and bright colors make it a popular aquarium fish, even though it can be difficult to keep.

The king angelfish is a non-migratory tropical fish that inhabits reefs in the eastern Pacific Ocean from the coast of Peru north to the Gulf of California, including offshore islands as far west as the Galapagos, generally at depth of  4–30 metres (13–98 ft).[2][3]

Males and females are visually identical. They do, however undergo significant changes in coloration and to a lesser degree shape as they mature.
Juvenile king angelfish are primarily yellow, with fins rimmed with iridescent blue, blue striping towards the posterior of their bodies, and an orange mask around the eye. Sexually mature king angelfish, on the other hand, have mostly brown or blue bodies (depending on the light) with the same blue rimming around the fins and a yellow tail.[3] 
King angelfish generally grow to 35 cm long. They have between 18 and 20 rays in their dorsal fin and each of their pectoral fins, and 17 to 19 in their anal fin. They also have a strong spike under their lower cheek for defensive purposes.

King angelfish primarily inhabit the middle and bottom of the water column of rocky tropical reefs,[2] including in the larger crevices between rocks, and juveniles can occasionally be found in tide pools. They are diurnal and feed on sponges, other sessile invertebrates, zooplankton, and certain species of benthic microalgae.[3] King angelfish also clean scalloped hammerhead sharks.

King angelfish are somewhat popular as aquarium fish; however, their large size, specialized diet, and high cost make them comparatively poor pets. They have not bred in captivity and hence can be very difficult to find in most hobby shops, although they are slightly more available through mail order companies.[4]
King angelfish also have a well-deserved reputation for being difficult to keep, largely because they require sponges and tunicates as a food source and will often not accept prepared foods, even ones that contain sponges or tunicates as ingredients.

They are not particularly picky about salinity or pH, so long as these are kept stable and the water quality high.

Angelfish in general are not generally good community inhabitants, king angels being no exception. If they are introduced when young, a lucky aquarist may be able to keep two angels in one appropriately size aquarium, but such experiences tend to be the exception, not the norm. King angelfish are quite dominant and can be abusive to smaller or more docile tankmates, or angelfish that are lower on the social hierarchy for whatever reason.[4]

King angelfish are monogamous within their pairs and, during their spawning cycle, will mate daily around sunset. During a spawning cycle a pair can produce upwards of ten million fertilized eggs, averaging about 25,000–75,000 daily. These eggs then drift in the water column for about 20 hours, at which point they hatch. After hatching, the finless fry live off their yolk sack until it is completely absorbed, at which point they begin to eat small zooplankton.[5]

The Pitcairn angelfish like the other angelfishes in the genus Genicanthus, shows sexual dichromatism, the males and females show differences in colour and pattern. The males have a white body which is marked with many vertical black stripes while the females have an overall bluish white colouration. In both sexes the forked tail narrows at its base to create a “swallow tail”.[3] The dorsal fin contains 15 spines and 17 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 18-19 soft rays.[4] This species attains a maximum total length of 35 centimetres (14 in).[2]

Genicanthus spinus is found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It has been recorded from the islands of Raivavae and Rurutu in the Austral Islands of French Polynesia  Dulcie Atoll in the UK Overseas Territory of the Pitcairn Islands and Rarotonga in the Cook Islands.[1]

Genicanthus spinus Is found on rock and coral reefs at depths between 30 and 60 metres (98 and 197 ft) (at least). it is normally encountered in groups that swim high in the water column, these are harems of 1 male and as many as 4 females. They feed mostly on zooplankton but may eat some benthic invertebrates.[2]

Genicanthus spinus was first formally described in 1975 by the American ichthyologists John E. Randall (1924–2020) with the type locality given as Bounty Bay on Pitcairn Island.[5] The specific name spinus means “spine” and refers to the very large anterior spine in front of the eye.[6]

Holacanthus semifasciatus Kamohara, 1934

Genicanthus semifasciatus, the  Japanese swallow, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish, belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is found in the Western Pacific.

Genicanthus semifasciatus is sexually dichromatic; the males and females show different colouration and patterning. The male has a yellow head and anterior flanks with a darker yellow dorsal area which is marked with dusky vertical bars. The dorsal area of females is greyish brown and white ventrally, with a yellow margin to the dorsal fin with a black head and caudal fin, and black on the head and tail. In both sexes the forked tail narrows at its base to create a ""swallow tail"".[3] The dorsal fin contains 15 spines and 15-16 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 17 soft rays. This species attains a maximum total length of 21 centimetres (8.3 in).[2]

Genicanthus semifasciatus is found in the Western Pacific Ocean. Here it is found from southern Japan, including the Ogasawara Islands, the Izu Islands and the Ryukyu Islands, to the northern Philippines.[1]

Genicanthus semifasciatus occurs at depths between 15 and 200 metres (49 and 656 ft).[1] Here it can be found on the seaward sides of rocky and coral reefs. This species is protogynously hermaphroditic and is normally encountered in harems consisting of a male and several females.[2] It feeds on plankton in the water column.[3]

Genicanthus semifasciatus was first formally described in 1934 as Holocanthus semifasciatus by the Japanese ichthyologist Toshiji Kamohara (1901-1972) with the type locality given as Kashiwajima in the Kochi Prefecture of Japan.[4] The specific name is a compound of semi  meaning “half” and fasciatus  meaning “banded”, referring to the banding on the males’ backs which does not extend onto the abdomen.[5]

Genicanthus semifasciatus is rather infrequently found in the aquarium trade.[3] The specimens which do appear in the trade usually come from the Philippines.[1]

Holacanthus xanthotis Fraser-Brunner, 1950

Apolemichthys xanthotis, the yellow-ear angelfish or Red Sea angelfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae.[1][3][2]

Apolemichthys xanthotis has a largely white coloured body with a black head, a yellow tail. The dorsal and anal fins are black with white margins.[4] The black on the head is more extensive than in the closely related Apolemichthys xanthotis extending across the Gill cover 
and over the first few scale rows on the body. This contrasts with the yellow spot on the upper preoperculum. The juveniles have a wide black band running over the eye and an oblique are of black on the back, this patch fades as the fish matures.[5] This species attains a maximum total length of 20 centimetres (7.9 in).[2]

Apolemichthys xanthotis is found in the northwestern Indian Ocean in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. It is also found off Socotra and a transient population was discovered off Kenya following the El Nino of 1998.[1]

Apolemichthys xanthotis lives at depths between 10 and 80 metres (33 and 262 ft) in areas that are rich in coral, as well as on rocky reefs.[1] It is typically encountered in pairs or small groups and probably feeds on algae and benthic invertebrates, especially sponges.[2]

Apolemichthys xanthotis was first formally described in 1950 as Holacanthus xanthotis by the British ichthyologist Alec Fraser-Bruner (1906–1986) with the type locality given as Al-Mukalla on the Red Sea coast of Yemen.[6] Its specific name xanthotis means “yellow ear” and refers to the yellow spot on the upper preoperculum.[7] Within the genus Apolemichthys this species seems to be more closely related to A. griffisi of the Western Pacific Ocean and the allopatric A. xanthurus of the Indian Ocean.[5]

Apolemichthys xanthotis is uncommon in the aquarium trade.[1] This is despite being considered to be a beautiful, hardy and easily maintained species.[4]

Holocanthus semicinctus Waite, 1900

The halfbanded angelfish (Genicanthus semicinctus) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

Genicanthus semicinctus like the other angelfishes in the genus Genicanthus, shows sexual dichromatism, the males and females show differences in colour and pattern. The males are marked with thin close-set wavy black, vertical bars which run from the back to two-thirds down the flanks with the lower third of the body being yellowish-orange. They have a yellow dorsal fin and yellow lobes with long filaments on the caudal fin which has black spots. The chest also has black spots. The females are plain dark grey on the back with a whitish abdomen and have dark lobes to the caudal fin. Their fins have thin blue margins and there is a black blotch above the eye, this has a vivid blue margin.[3] The dorsal fin contains 15 spines and 15-16 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 17 soft rays. This species attains a maximum total length of 21 centimetres (8.3 in).[2]

Genicanthus semicinctus is found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Here it is found only around Lord Howe Island, an Australian territory in the Tasman Sea, and the New Zealand outlying islands of the Kermadec Islands.[1]

Genicanthus semicinctus is found at depths between 10 and 100 metres (33 and 328 ft).[1] it is found on the deep outer slopes of coral and rocky reefs. It normally occurs in small groups, harems of a male and as many as 4 females. This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite and if the male in a group disappears the dominant female will change into a male, this change takes a few weeks.[3]

Genicanthus semicinctus was first formally described as Holocanthus semicinctus in 1900 by the British-born Australian ichthyologist Edgar Ravenswood Waite (1866–1928) with the type locality given as Lord Howe Island.[4] The specific name is a compound of semi meaning “half” and cinctus meaning “bands”.[5]

Genicanthus semicinctus is very rare in the aquarium trade.[1]

Holacanthus rhomboides Gilchrist & Thompson, 1908

The old woman angelfish (Pomacanthus rhomboides) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is found in the western Indian Ocean.

The old woman angelfish, as an adult it is possibly the least colourful of the genus Pomacanthus. The adults are bronze brown on the anterior two thirds of their bodies with the posterior third being pale bluish grey. The juveniles resemble the juveniles of other species in the genus and are, therefore, more colourful than the adults. They are mainly black with thin, want blue and white lines.[3] The dorsal fin contains 11-13 spines and 22-25 soft rays while the anal fin contains 3 spines and 21-23 soft rays. This species attains a maximum total length of 46 centimetres (18 in).[2]

The old woman angelfish is found in the western Indian Ocean. It is found from Maputo Bay in Mozambique southwards along the coast of South Africa as far as Knysna in the Western Cape.[1]

The old woman angelfish is found along shorelines and on rocky reefs at depths between 5 and 30 m (16 and 98 ft). The juveniles are found in shallow tidal pools.[1] The adults live in small groups close to the coast where they feed on algae and benthic invertebrates.[4] They will occasionally swim near the surface to feed on plankton.[1]

The old woman angelfish was first formally described in 1908 as Holacanthus rhomboides by the Scots ichthyologist John Dow Fisher Gilchrist (1866–1926) and his South African colleague William Wardlaw Thompson (died 1917) with the type locality given as KwaZulu-Natal.[5] The species is placed by some authorities in the subgenus Acanthochaetodon,. The specific name of this species, rhomboides means “rhombus-like”, possibly a reference to its deep, almost quadrangular body.[6]

The old woman angelfish has a range which does not overlap with the main areas of Africa's coast where fish are collected for the aquarium trade and is subsequently extremely rare in that trade.[7]

阿拉伯仙,Pomacanthus asfur,阿拉伯刺盖鱼,鲈形目,"

Pomacanthus asfur, the Arabian angelfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is found in the Western Indian Ocean.

Pomacanthus asfur has a completely different colour and pattern as a juvenile from that of the adult. Juveniles have a blue body which is marked with pale-blue and white stripes. As they mature they develop yellow markings on their dorsal and caudal fins. Until as fully mature adults they have an overall dark blue body with a blackish face, a yellow caudal fin and a broad crescent-shaped yellow band running vertically across the flanks.[3] The dorsal fin has 12 spines and 19–20 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 19–20 soft rays, the pectoral fins each contain 17 or 18 rays.[4] This species attains a maximum total length of 40 cm (16 in).[2]

Pomacanthus asfur is principally found in the western Indian Ocean. Here it is found in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and along the coast of eastern Africa as far south as Zanzibar.[1] It has been recorded, as a probable release of aquarium specimens, on a few occasions off the eastern coast of Florida[4] and from Malta.[5]

Pomacanthus asfur has been recorded at depths between 3 and 30 metres (9.8 and 98.4 ft).[1] It is a common species where there are relatively sheltered inshore reefs which have rich growth of soft and hard corals with a few patches of silty seabed. Their diet is dominated by sponges and tunicates.[2] It is a solitary and shy fish that divers find difficult to approach \and it is normally recorded near caves or crevices in the reef.[1] This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite, the larger fish in a pair will change sex to become male.[6]

Pomacanthus asfur had its first formal described published in 1775 by the Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius (1745–1808) but it has commonly been attributed to Finnish born Swede Peter Forsskål (1732–1763) the type locality is given as Al-Luhayya in Yemen.[7] Some authorities place this species in the subgenus Arusetta, of which it is the type species[8] The specific name asfur is this species Arabic name in Yemen.[9]

Pomacanthus asfur is infrequently found in the aquarium trade.[1] It has been bred in captivity and captive bred specimens are sometimes marketed as ""half-moon angelfish"".[3]

红面小丑,Elacatinus puncticulatus,红脑霓虹鰕虎,鲈形目,"

Elacatinus puncticulatus is a species of goby from the eastern central Pacific Ocean, where it is found on reefs from the Gulf of California to Ecuador.  This species occurs at depths ranging from 1 to 21m, and usually in association with the sea urchin Eucidaris thouarsii. The size of the goby varies depending on sex, with females being typically smaller than males, and their geographical location as well as their role as a cleaner goby also has impacts on their morphology.[2] Due to their bright coloration and lack of aggression, the species is commonly found in the aquarium trade.[3][4]

Elacatinus puncticulatus is a member of the family Gobiidae, which is broken up into two genera: Elacatinus and Gobiosoma. Elacatinus is a genus of goby fish comprising 25 species with characteristic 7 spines, 28 vertebrae, compressed skull shape, and transparent fins. E. puncticulatus are the only species in the genus that display a lack of scales on the head and body.[4] The E. puncticulatus species in particular is characterized by the strong red and blue coloration on its head, with yellow and black striped coloration on its body, and a dark horizontal stripe behind its eye.[5] The blue stripe near the head of many Elacatinus species is often seen as an adaptation that allows the fish to effectively attract clients that they clean as a part of their role as a symbiotic cleaner species.[2] The species is sometimes broken up into two clades, with subclades within those, based on interspecific variations seen in both their coloration and genetics. Those variations are believed to have been a result of oceanographic processes and habitat discontinuities that separated different E. puncticulatus groups over time. Depending on their location, different members of the species display different colors on their head, body, and eye stripes, which can range from red to more of a yellow-orange.[6]

Their general size differs depending on sex, with males reaching around 30-40mm in length while females only reach around 22-27mm and this size difference between the sexes increases as general latitude increases.[4] Besides just geographic location, their role as a cleaner goby also has an impact on their morphology. Elacatinus as a genus typically displays a terminal mouth position that corresponds to their roles as cleaner fish, but E. puncticulatus specifically display a heterodont dentition as well, meaning they have more than one type of tooth morphology. This differentiates them from other cleaner species in their genus, but is characteristic of their role as an occasional, or facultative, cleaner (as compared to dedicated, or obligate, cleaners).[2]

E. puncticulatus are a shallow-living goby found along the continental shore of the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), which ranges from the Southern tip of the California peninsula to the South of Ecuador. Specifically within this area, the species live primarily between the subtidal zone and depths of 21m on rocky or coral reefs.[4][5][6] Their habitat on coral reefs, considered “cleaning stations”, which combined with the bright blue coloration on parts of their head allows the species to attract clients and feed off of the removed ectoparasites.[2] They are the only species of the genus Elacatinus not found in the Atlantic, and only one of two species in the genus found in the TEP.  Their distribution is shaped by habitat discontinuities that restrict their dispersal in the area, one of the most notable examples being two muddy sections of shore within the TEP.[6]

Elacatinus puncticulatus display active courtship before spawning and parental behaviors after spawning. Males of E. puncticulatus show a gray head and yellow and black body coloration instead of their usual red and blue head coloration. One day prior to spawning, males move their pectoral fins to promote burrow cleanliness and display heavy breathing to signify readiness. Females of E. puncticulatus display strong red and black colors, but become pale three days before spawning. The male knows the female is ready to spawn because her urogenital region turns from brown to red the day prior to spawning.[5] The genus Elacatinus are primarily gonochoristic, do not change sex, and often maintain stable monogamous relationships throughout their life.[7]

E. puncticulatus produce benthic eggs that give rise to pelagic larvae.[6] Male E. puncticulatus clean the dead eggs after hatching, but sometimes they will clean the eggs before hatching, which leads to a loss of up to 50% of the eggs.[5] E. puncticulatus produce around 150 eggs per spawn, but only about 100 will actually hatch and produce pelagic larvae. The eggs range in size from 0.4 to 0.7mm. A heartbeat can be detected at 120 hours post fertilization (5 days) when they grow most rapidly and have the highest mortality. Spontaneous hatching takes about an hour and a half to complete and occurs 168 hours after fertilization (7 days). The incubation and embryonic development stages of E. puncticulatus are similar to those of Elacatinus figaro.[5] There is a lot unknown about E. puncticulatus larval stage including distribution and time spent in the pelagic larval stage, but similar Elacatinus species have a range of 21–38 days.[6]

Elacatinus puncticulatus are found in corals in the continental shelf of the TEP. They often live in association with sea urchins, although the reason for this is undetermined.[6] The Elacatinus genus feeds primarily on ectoparasites from cleaning and cellular fish debris, and E. puncticulatus seem to be no different.[5] Both males and females clean. Cleaning gobies can display cheating behavior when cleaning with a partner, where they consume scales and mucus from the clients instead of just ectoparasites, although this is uncommon in the Elacatinus genus. When cleaning with the opposite sex, males tend to modify behavior to be more cooperative and females tend to stay the same.[7] Clients of this cleaning mutualism are either non-predatory fish like parrotfishes,[8] or piscivorous fish that are potential predators for the goby, like longfin damselfish,[9] yellowtail damselfish,[10] and graysby grouper.[11] While some clients are predatory to E. puncticulatus and other cleaner gobies, the predatory clients are often immediately cleaned upon arrival, which could help their identification as a cleaner and reduce the risk of predation.[9] The immediate cleaning of those predator clients may reduce the risk of predation, but it does not provide any foraging advantage since predator clients and non-predator clients offer the same amount of ectoparasites, and predatory clients often decrease the visits made by the more abundant non-predatory clients.[9][8]

The 25 species of Elacatinus are considered ""neon gobies"" due to their brightly colored appearance and the variety of coloration they display. Along with their attractive appearance, their ability to become domesticated rather easily as well as their relatively calm disposition make them more appealing to those involved in the aquarium trade of marine fish and coral. As a result of this, many of the species, including the bright red and blue E. puncticulatus are kept for ornamental purposes in many different regions.[5]

Elacatinus puncticulatus is commonly found in the aquarium trade industry, because new technologies have made it easier to manage captive marine species.[5] The United States Fish and Wildlife Service CITES program requires certain species to be named specifically when trading, but E. puncticulatus is not on the list.[12] E. puncticulatus is referred to as marine tropical fish in reports. It can be difficult for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to regulate their trade and study their endangerment status.[12]

Gobius semicinctus Bennett, 1833

Amblygobius semicinctus, the halfbarred goby , is a species of goby from family Gobiidae.

The Halfbarred goby is a small fish which can reach a length of 11 centimetres (4.3 in) TL.[1] Its background body colour is greenish brown with a kind of complex pattern of red-brown longitudinal lines running along the body and spots on the head. A dark line starting from the snout passing through the eye and melt backside with the other longitudinal lines. The body is also marked with 4 to 6 vertical black bars, a dark ocellus on the first dorsal fin and on the operculum, and finally a dark spot on the superior part of the caudal fin.[2]

Amblyeleotris semicinctus is found in the western Indian Ocean from the Maldives to the eastern African coast. 
It likes sandy bottom in protected and shallow lagoons and bays. It lives usually in couple in a burrow dug under a rock or a piece of coral.[3]

This goby is an omnivorous fish which feeds by taking in mouthfuls of sand and sifting out algae, invertebrates and other organic matter.[4] The species is monogamous.[5]

黑线虾虎,Valenciennea helsdingenii,双带凡塘鳢,鲈形目,"

Valenciennea helsdingenii is a species of goby from the Indo-Pacific. It is commonly known as the twostripe goby, black-lined sleeper goby, or railway sleeper goby. It can grow up to a length of 25 cm (9.8 in) and is distinguishable by two prominent orange to black lines running longitudinally through its body.

Twostripe gobies were first described by the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in 1858 as Eleotriodes helsdingenii. The type specimens were originally collected from Pulau-Pulau Gorong, Maluku, Indonesia. It belongs to the hover goby genus Valenciennea in the true goby family, Gobiidae.[2] The specific name honours the Dutch civil servant W. F. C. van Helsdingen, who provided Bleeker with a number of well-preserved fish specimens from the Gorong Archipelago in the Dutch East Indies, including the type specimen of this species.[3]

The body of twostripe gobies is elongated and laterally compressed.[4] They are commonly 18 cm (7.1 in) in length, with a maximum length of 25 cm (9.8 in).[2][5] The body is predominantly white to pale gray in color, with the dorsal surface a darker brownish gray. It has two prominent orange, dark red, reddish-brown, or black lines running longitudinally on the sides of its body, darkest at the anterior end and growing lighter towards the back. The upper line begins from the front of the snout, goes through the eye, and ends at the tip of the upper fork of the caudal fin. The lower line is parallel to the upper line and begins from the side of the upper lip, through the middle of the base of pectoral fins, and ends at the tip of the lower fork of the caudal fin. Both upper and lower lines are outlined in white at the caudal fin. A large oval black spot is also present between the third and fifth spines of the dorsal fin.[4]

The pelvic fins are completely separated, no membrane is present between the first and the second dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is shallow and its margin rounded, and the fourth spine is slightly longer than the other spines.[4] The caudal fin in adults is deeply notched with two long filaments. Juveniles have more rounded caudal fins.[2]

Twostripe gobies are relatively rare. They usually occur in pairs, but can be found alone in silty flat sand patches or rubble substrates.[6] They are usually found on outer reefs at the bottom of coral or rocky dropoffs, rarely in lagoons. They feed on small digging (fossorial) organisms by sifting them from mouthfuls of sand.[7]

Eggs hatch two days after spawning and the larvae reach lengths of 5.25 mm (0.207 in) after 35 days.[7] Juveniles are usually found near rocks in clear estuaries.[2]

The fish is carnivore, feeding on small invertebrates.[6]

Twostripe gobies have a wide distribution range. They can be found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. From the coast of East Africa, the southern Red Sea, the Maldives, southeast India and Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, Australia, western Oceania, and Japan.[2][4]

Amblygobius decussatus, the orange-striped goby, is a species of goby native to tropical reefs in the western Pacific Ocean,[1] but may be widespread in the central Indo-Pacific area.  It prefers living on muddy substrates where it utilizes an invertebrate burrow for shelter.  It sifts through mouthfuls of sand, consuming organic matter and small invertebrates contained therein.  This species can reach a length of 9.5 centimetres (3.7 in) SL.[2]  It can also be found in the aquarium trade.[3]

红灯虾虎,Eviota pellucida,透体矶塘鳢,鲈形目,"

Eviota pellucida, commonly called neon pygmy goby or pellucida pygmy goby, is a species of marine fish in the family Gobiidae.

It reaches a maximum size of 21 millimetres (0.83 in) in length.[2] Its body is a transparent orange/red colour, with a yellow/gold line stretching from its head the base of its tail, one on its side stretching through its eye to 2/3 of the way down its body, and two lines over its head. All lines originate near the upper lip. A white line along the stomach is also present.

The Neon pygmy goby is widespread throughout the tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean and has been recorded from the Ryukyu Islands, Pohnpei, Guam, Marshall Islands and Abaiang Atoll in Kiribati records elsewhere represent Eviota atriventris.[3][4]

It can be found at depths of 3–30 metres (98 ft).[5]

Sticking to lagoonal areas with much shelter, these fishes are often found in groups, browsing for microinvertebrates (and seeking refuge) among the branches of small-polyped stony corals, as well as sometimes cleaning parasites and dead tissues from larger fish.

Occasionally making its way into the aquarium trade, this is a hardy little specimen. Its diet in captivity consists of small invertebrates including copepods and amphipod larvae, and they may occasionally be seen clearing other fish of parasites and dead tissues. They will sometimes accept pelleted foods and often frozen foods like mysis shrimp. An environment that is branchy or with many perches is most suitable, and SPS will often be enjoyed as a home. Macroalgaes and porous rock will provide much enjoyable browsing for these fish.

Pseudochromis aldabraensis, the orange dottyback, neon dottyback or Arabian dottyback, is a species of ray-finned fish from the family Pseudochromidae, the dottybacks. It is commonly kept in marine aquariums. [2]

Its natural range is in the western Indian Ocean around Aldabra, in the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf as far east as India and Sri Lanka. It occurs on offshore coral and rocky reefs as deep as 25 metres (82 ft) where it is a secretive species which quickly hides if disturbed.[3]

It is the hardier of the non-tank raised pseudochromises. They prefer to stay at the bottom of the tank. They get along extremely well with blue damsels and other kinds of damselfish.[4] Otherwise, they can be fairly aggressive.[2]

蓝线,Pseudochromis springeri,斯氏拟雀鲷,鲈形目,"

Pseudochromis springeri, also known as blue-striped dottyback, is a popular saltwater aquarium fish from the red sea and eastern Indian Ocean. The specific name honours the American ichthyologist Victor G. Springer of the Smithsonian Institution.[1]

A small marine fish that reaches two inches in length. It is dark blue or black with blue stripes along its head and fins.

Pseudochromis springeri is a hardy member of a saltwater aquarium. As one of the few saltwater fish that can be bred in captivity. Use of tank bred individuals in aquariums is often encouraged to reduce the pressure on wild populations. Twenty gallons is typically quoted as the minimum tank size required to permanently house this fish, although it can be raised in as little as ten gallons with a risk of it harassing any other fish and invertebrates in its tank.

It is less aggressive than most dottybacks but will sometimes harass small, passive, fish and shrimp. It can be quite territorial meaning it is best to only keep one in an aquarium. If more than one is kept in an aquarium it is important that they are added at the same time.  Despite its hardy nature, it also must not be placed in an aquarium with larger predatory fish such as lion fish, and grouper which will often see it as a food source.

Hemiramphus fluviatilis Bleeker, 1850

The wrestling halfbeak (Dermogenys pusilla) also known as Malayan halfbeak is a species of viviparous halfbeak native to the fresh and brackish waters of rivers and coastal regions in South-East Asia, in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra.[2][3] It is a small, slender, livebearing fish, with the elongated lower jaw characteristic of its family. The colour of this species varies, depending on where the specimen is found.[4] It is the type species of the genus Dermogenys.[5]

Wrestling halfbeaks are surface-feeding fish and feed on a variety of small invertebrates including crustaceans and insect larvae, but especially mosquito larvae and flying insects that have fallen onto the surface of the water.[6] As with all halfbeaks, the upper jaw lifts upwards when the fish is opening its mouth. Wrestling halfbeaks are livebearing fish, the females giving birth to around twenty offspring after a gestation period of about a month.[7][8][9]

Wrestling halfbeaks are sexually dimorphic. The females are larger than the males and grow up to 7 cm (3 in) long; males only reach about 5.5 cm (2.2 in) and typically has red or yellow patches on the dorsal fin and the beak.[10][11] The males of wrestling halfbeaks will fight among themselves by locking jaws, hence their name, for up to thirty minutes.

This species was described as Dermogenys pusillus by Heinrich Kuhl and Johan Coenraad van Hasselt in 1823 with the type locality given as Bogor, Java, the name was subsequently amended to the feminine form.[12]

In the wild, and in large aquaria, the weaker male will quickly disengage and swim away, and fights therefore rarely result in serious injury to either party. However, in their native range, local people sometimes use wrestling halfbeaks as fighting fish for betting purposes (like fighting cocks or siamese fighting fish).[13][14]

Wrestling halfbeaks, as well as other species in the genus Dermogenys, are quite widely traded as aquarium fish, sometimes under the ""silver halfbeak"" or ""golden halfbeak"" names, depending on the colouration of the fish. As with all freshwater halfbeaks, these fish are sensitive to sudden changes in pH and hardness, but they are otherwise adaptable, and can be maintained in anything from soft and acid freshwater through to slightly brackish water.[15][16] When first introduced into the aquarium, wrestling halfbeaks are nervous fish that tend to be timid. They may swim frantically if suddenly frightened, even crashing into the walls. However, once they are used to their surroundings, they become lively, easy to care for fish.[17][18]

Hyphessobrycon anisitsi

The Buenos Aires tetra (Psalidodon anisitsi)[1] is a tropical fish from South America. It was first observed in the wild in 1907, by Carl H. Eigenmann.

An aquarium subject for over 60 years, the Buenos Aires tetra is a well loved aquarium fish, often admired for its flashy red color.

The Buenos Aires tetra originates from its namesake, South America. They are found in South America in the La Plata region of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southeastern Brazil.[2] In the wild, they are commonly found in rivers, ponds, lakes, and streams, namely, in the La Plata region. They are a freshwater fish, and do not do well in conditions that may offer too salty or too filthy water. They swim in schools and are a social fish, always together with their own kind.

The tetra is a tropical, silver metallic-colored fish, with red-tipped fins and a black marking on the dorsal fin. The tetra is a hardy community fish for beginners, and is optimal for the beginning fish hobbyist.[2] It is also relatively large for a tetra, growing up to 7.5 cm (3 inches).[2] They can live up to 5 or 6 years. Its silver color picks up flashy neon highlights depending on how the light hits the fish. The top and bottom of the tail fin is generally red, along with the pelvic and anal fins. The dorsal fin may also have a hint of red at the very tip. Its most distinguishing characteristic is the caudal peduncle, or the connecting area between the tail and the rest of the body, which features a bold, black 'cross' shape.[2]

The Buenos Aires tetra are very durable, and do not have any special needs or requirements. A maintained freshwater tank and food is all that they really need. However, they are hearty feeders that must be well-fed or they may begin to nip at their long-finned tank-mates. Keeping the tetras in a school of 5 or more definitely decreases aggression. This species can occasionally nip at and eat aquarium plants.[2]

Buenos Aires tetras are an omnivorous species. In the wild they feed on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plants, but in the aquarium they will generally eat all kinds of live, fresh, and flake foods. To keep a good balance, give them a high quality flake food every day. To keep these tetras at their best and most colorful, offer regular meals of live and frozen foods, such as bloodworms, Daphnia, and brine shrimp. Vegetables should also be added to their diet. Feed these tetras several times a day and only what they can consume in 3 minutes or less at each feeding.[2]

Buenos Aires tetras breed occasionally in an aquarium setting. They breed by scattering their eggs into their environment,[3] hoping that they will be fertilized and lead to young. When breeding does occur, a hospital or ""breeding tank"" will be necessary. For optimal breeding conditions, use slightly acidic water. Much like most other species of fish, once the eggs begin to hatch, removing the parents will reduce the number of lost fry, as the parents will soon begin to eat their young.[4] Once the eggs are laid, the fry will begin to hatch in about 24 hours. For the next three or four days, they will eat their egg sac and then become free swimming fry.[3]

The flame hawkfish (Neocirrhites armatus) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a hawkfish belonging to the family Cirrhitidae. It is native to tropical reefs of the Pacific Ocean at depths of from 1 to 10 metres (3.3 to 32.8 ft). This species is also found in the aquarium trade.  It is the only known member of its genus.

The flame hawkfish was first formally described in 1873 by the French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau with the type locality given as Noble Island in the Torres Strait off Queensland.[2] Laporte placed the new species he was describing in its own monotypic genus.[3] The genus name is a compound of neo meaning “new” and Cirrhites, an alternative spelling of the type genus of the family Cirrhitidae, Cirrhitus. The specific name armatus  means ""armed"" a reference to the spines on the preoperculum.[4]

The flame hawkfish has a very deep, highly compressed body, its standard length being two to two and a half times its depth with a moderately long snout. The mouth has an outer row of canine teeth and an inner row of much smaller villiform teeth, the canines are notably larger at the front of the upper jaw and side of the lower jaw but there are no teeth on the palatine. There is a tuft of cirri and a flap on the posterior edge of the anterior nostril. The preoperculum has large serrations on at least its upper three quarters.[5] The dorsal fin contains 10 spines and 13 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 6-7 soft rays.[6] The dorsal fin spines are short, at the tip of each spine there is a tassel of cirri and the membranes between the spines are only weakly incised. The caudal fin is weakly rounded.[7] The six lowest pectoral fin rays are unbranched and robust and the longest rays do not reach past the tips of the pelvic fins.[5] This fish reaches a maximum total length of 9 centimetres (3.5 in).[6] This species is bright red with areas of black around eyes and beneath the dorsal fin.[8]

The flame hawkfish is found in the western Pacific where its range extends as far north as the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands of Japan across the Pacific as far as the Pitcairn Islands and south to the Great Barrier Reef off Queensland. This species may be found as deep as 25 m (82 ft), but is more commonly encountered between 10 and 15 m (33 and 49 ft).[1] It is a common species on reef fronts with exposure to tidal surge and on underwater terraces.[6]

The flame hawkfish is typically observed using the branches of live corals to hide among. The preferred species are Stylophora mordax, Pocillopora elegans, P. eydouxi, or P. verrucosa and it flees deep into the coral if approached. Their diet comprises small crustaceans. It is an oviparous pelagic spawner which breeds in monogamous pairs.[6] The adults do not have a swim bladder and use their robust pelvic fins as supports when perching on corals.[9]

The flame hawkfish is collected for the aquarium trade and it can be quite commonly available and is one of the more popular species of hawkfish for the hobby aquarium,[9] however, it is reportedly expensive and difficult to properly maintain.[6]

Tetrosomus gibbosus, commonly called camel cowfish because of the hump on its dorsal keel, is one of 22 species in the boxfish family, Ostraciidae.[2] It is a ray finned fish. Other common names include helmet cowfish, humpback turretfish and thornbacked boxfish. It is  most closely related to T. reipublicae, the smallspine turretfish.[3] T. gibbosus is a species of boxfish found in the wide Indo-West Pacific. It has been recorded  since 1988 on rare occasions in the Levantine waters of the Mediterranean Sea, likely following entry via the Suez Canal.[4] It is the first species from the family Ostraciidae to be found in the Mediterranean Sea.[5]

It carries some value in the aquarium trade, but is difficult to keep.[6]

T. gibbosus is normally around 20 centimetres (7.9 in) long when it is fully grown, but can reach up to 30 centimetres (12 in) in length.[7] Fish in the genus Tetrosomus are characterized by the presence of a carapace, a hard upper shell formed by thick scale plates.[3] The body is completely encased in this bony shell, except for a few small openings such as the mouth, eyes, and gills.[8] The mouth is small with fleshy lips and conical teeth usually numbering less than 15.[8]

T. gibbosus has poisonous flesh, organs, and spines, and is known to secret poisonous mucus in defense or when it is disturbed.[7] This poison can be fatal to humans or other marine organisms that come into contact with it.[7] T. gibbosus is hermaphroditic; all individuals of this species are born female, but some may change into males as they grow.[7] Juveniles live together in small schools, but individuals become solitary as they mature into adulthood.[7] T. gibbosus is an omnivorous species, and its diet is known to include seaweeds, sponges, molluscs, worms, and crustaceans found on the bottom of its habitat.[7]

T. gibbosus lives in shallow tropical waters or warm seas with muddy bottoms and can sometimes be seen near shallow seagrass beds.[9][8] It is also found in coral reefs.[10] It is considered an endangered species in the South China Sea.[10]

A Lessepsian migration refers to the migration of a marine species from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, facilitated by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. A species is considered Lessepsian when it has completed this migration and established a population. T. gibbosus was first found in the Mediterranean Sea in 1988.[11] Both the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea have similar salinity levels and temperature ranges, which allows for an easier transition between of these bodies of water.[12][5] It is thought that Lessepsian species migrated due to changing climates, since the geographic land barrier was removed when the Suez Canal was completed.[11] T. gibbosus is now considered an invasive species in the Mediterranean Sea, as this is not included in its native distribution.[11] It is also considered an established species because it has established a growing population and has been found in multiple locations.[12] It is the first species from the family Ostraciidae to be found in the Mediterranean Sea.[5] Due to its inability to swim long distances, T. gibbosus likely took multiple generations to migrate from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea; this is thought to have happened, in part, from northward currents moving eggs and larvae north towards the Mediterranean Sea.[5]

牛角,lactoria cornuta,unk,鲀形目,"

The longhorn cowfish (Lactoria cornuta), also called the horned boxfish, is a species of boxfish from the family Ostraciidae, recognizable by its long horns that protrude from the front of its head, rather like those of a cow or bull.[1]  They are a resident of the Indo-Pacific region and can grow up to 50 cm (20 in) long. 

Adults are reef fish, often solitary and territorial, and live around sand or rubble bottom up to a depth of 50 m (160 ft). They are omnivorous, feeding upon benthic algae, various microorganisms, and foraminiferans that it strains from sediments, sponges, polychaete worms from sand flats, mollusks, small crustaceans, and small fish, able to feed on benthic invertebrates by blowing jets of water into the sandy substrate. Longhorn cowfish protect the coral reefs they live in by being predators of the invertebrates that destroy the reefs. They are also important in the growth and creation of coral reefs for this same reason.[2] According to the IUCN, the Longhorn cowfish is categorized as “Not Evaluated”.[3] While this may eventually be impacted by aquarium trade, currently there is no concern now. 

Its primary habitat is coral reefs in lagoons, on reef flats, estuaries, bays, and on protected seaward reefs.[4] Juveniles associate with Acropora corals. Depth range is 3.3–148 ft (1–45 m, perhaps up to 100 m).

Red Sea and East Africa eastward through Indonesia to Marquesas, northward to southern Japan. Including Tuamotus, southern Korea, north to the Ryukyu Islands of southern Japan, south to Australia and Lord Howe Island, and off southern Africa in the Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical waters. The specimens found in India are a new development in the last couple years, and it is speculated that cyclones or typhoons brought the Lactoria cornuta to a new environment.[5][6]

There is no known sexual dimorphism, so both male and female display a yellow to olive base color, which is decorated with white or bluish spots. Paired courtship just before or after sunset. Eggs and ichthyoplankton are pelagic. Females generally are larger than males. Males grow to be 65-155 mm with an average of 103 mm, while females grow to be 83-250 mm with an average of 121 mm. Female longhorn cowfish also weigh more than males with a weight range of 17-156 g with an average of 33 g while males have a weight range of 12-116 g with an average of 26 g.[4]

One distinction from other fish is the lack of a gill cover, which is replaced by a small slit or hole.
The hexagonal plate-like scales of these fish are fused together into a solid, triangular, box-like carapace, from which the fins and tail protrude. They have large eyes immediately behind the horns.[4] Their unique method of swimming, called ostraciiform swimming, causes them to look as if they are hovering.
They have no pelvic skeleton, so they lack pelvic fins.
The tail fin of the longhorn cowfish can be the same length as its body, as it relies on its fins for movement.[7] They are such slow swimmers cowfish are easily caught by hand, making a grunting noise when captured.
The cowfish are also able to produce two kinds of sounds using muscles connected to their swim bladder, hums and clicks.[8] This species of cowfish is the most well-known cowfish species in the aquarium trade.

If severely stressed, this species may be able to exude deadly toxin, pahutoxin, an ichthyotoxic, hemolytic, heat-stable, non-dialyzable, non-protein poison in the mucous secretions of their skin. It is apparently unique among known fish poisons; it is toxic to the boxfish and mimics sea cucumber toxins in general properties.

The horns of the Longhorn cowfish may have evolved to make it more difficult to swallow for predators.  The horns of the boxfish can be used to ward off predators through charging at the predator.[9] If damaged, these horns can grow back within a few months.[10] These horns are mostly hollow and composed of mineralized collagen fibers.[11] Both the hard armor exoskeleton and the use of the toxic secretion are solid defenses against predators. There are also egg predators like labrids and pomacentridae. Larger species in the family are able to ward off the egg predators, but the Longhorn Cowfish spawn close to the substrate in order to hide themselves and their eggs from the predators.[12]

This fish forms harems with 3-4 females in each one. The females spawn shortly after sunset, or during the day when there is a large amount of cloud cover. The spawning season lasts from February to early October.[12] The oval eggs of members of the Lactoria family hatch into the juvenile larvae. These larvae are distinct because they form the box carapace armor that is present on the longhorn cowfish.[13]

On Pamban Island, the local belief was that when the land got separated, the cows on the island metamorphosed into these fish and fed on seaweed.[14]

龙纹木瓜,aracana aurita,unk,鲀形目,"

Aracana aurita, striped cowfish, Shaw's cowfish, striped boxfish, painted boxfish, southern cowfish or Shaw's boxfish is a species of boxfish native to the Eastern Indian Ocean. The species was first described by George Shaw in 1798.[1] It is carnivorous and exposes prey in the benthic zone by blowing a jet of water onto sediment.[2]

The striped cowfish is larger than its close cousin the ornate cowfish, with a maximum length of 20 cm.[3] The species is sexually dimorphic. Females and juveniles are pale orange to brown, with irregular brown and white lines, while males bright orange with blue lines and spots.[2]

The fish's body is encased in a rigid box-like carapace made of large bony plates.[2] It has three curved spines on top, one on the mid side and three along the bottom.

The striped cowfish lives in temperate waters of the eastern Indian Ocean, around southern Australia, and by some other islands of Oceania. It primarily lives among sea grass beds and rocky reef at a depth of 10–200 meters.[4][5]

花木瓜,ostracion meleagris,unk,鲀形目,"

The spotted or white-spotted boxfish (Ostracion meleagris), is a species of boxfish found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  It is found on reefs at depths of from 1 to 30 metres (3.3 to 98.4 feet).  This species grows to a length of 25 centimetres (9.8 inches). Males and females differ in colour: males are blackish on the back with white spots, and have bluish sides with bright yellowish bands and spots. Females and juveniles are dark brown to blackish with white spots.[1]  As with other species of boxfish, the spotted boxfish's bony carapace gives it a distinctly angular appearance; it has been described as resembling an ottoman.[2]

The Spotted Boxfish has an oblong thick body that are enclosed in a bony box formed by thickened, joined, enlarged, and hexagonal scale plates.[3] Juveniles with male patterns or colors are never seen or has never been spotted before; either the juvenile males are born with the female colors, or all the young juveniles are born as a female and change their sex later in their life. [4]

Their diet consists of sponges, worms, tunicates as well as other small invertebrates.[5]

Their box has openings for the mouth, eyes, gill slits, fins, and tail base. Their backs are slightly rounded. They have a pair of longitudinal ridges on their lower flanks, a flat bottom, and no spines. Their small mouth opens at the front with fleshy lips and has 15 mid-sized teeth on each jaw. Their gill openings are short and form oblique slits in front of their pectoral base. Their anal and dorsal fins are at the rear; their caudal fin is rounded; their dorsal fin has no spines; and, they do not have pelvic fins.[6]

The Spotted Boxfish make noises and sounds during the mating process. For example, when mating, the male or female, sometimes both, make a low pitched humming sound that lasts for about 6 seconds. Another example is after the mating process, when another male comes to “spawn” with the female or to disrupt the mating process, the two males fight each other, sometimes creating an audible thump sound & they even produce a short buzzing sound.[7]

They are protected by a toxic slime that can kill other fish, thus making them unsuitable for use in aquariums.[8]

They can be found in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. They can also be found in seaward and protected reefs.[9] That’s just where the adults reside most of the time, whilst the juveniles often find shelter between the long spines of the tropical sea urchins anchored to the rocks.[10]

Phillip Lobel, an ichthyologist, found out that they mate during the afternoon and the early evening hours. The Spotted Boxfish species usually travel in a group, consisting of one male and several females. They start the mating process by the male nudging and circling one female. When she responds, they swim side-by-side while rising 6 ft or more from the bottom. The male leads the female to that point. Staying in that side-by-side formation with their tails together & heads slightly apart from one another, they both release their gametes (a mature haploid male or female germ cell which is able to unite with another of the opposite sex in sexual reproduction) and swim back to the bottom again together. Unfortunately, when that process is done and they both are with each other at the bottom again, it calls males to the female Boxfish to disrupt the process or calls them to mate with her instead, and that’s why fights are not uncommon between male Spotted Boxfishes.[11]

黄木瓜,ostracion cubicus,unk,鲀形目,"

The yellow boxfish (Ostracion cubicum) is a species of boxfish found in reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean as well as the southeastern Atlantic Ocean. Recorded occasionally since 2011 in the Levantine waters of the Mediterranean Sea which it likely entered via the Suez Canal, it is a species appreciated in the aquarium trade.[1]

O. cubicum reaches a maximum length of 45 centimetres (18 in). As the name suggests, it is box-shaped. Boxfish are also known for their armored and rigid body which in most cases would inhibit locomotion. This disadvantage is offset by the boxfish's carapace shape which is much more advantageous for its adapted style of swimming, known as ostraciiform locomotion.[2] When juvenile, it is bright yellow in color. As it ages, the brightness fades and very old specimens have blue-grey to black coloration with faded yellow.

While they are mainly known to reside in Indian coasts, earlier records show that this species has earlier reports in the Lakshadweep Islands, Andaman & Nicobar Islands as well as the Chennai coast

The yellow boxfish's diet consists mainly of marine algae, but it may also feed on worms, sponges, crustaceans, molluscs, and small fish.[3]

When stressed or injured it releases the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) from its skin, which may prove lethal to fish in surrounding waters.[4] The bright yellow color and black spots are a form of warning coloration (aposematism) to any potential predators.[5]

Yellow boxfish are solitary animals. Breeding occurs during the spring, in small groups that consist of 1 male and 2–4 females.[6]

In 2006, Mercedes-Benz unveiled its Bionic concept car, which was inspired by the shape of the yellow boxfish.[7] It was assumed that due to the extreme agility with which boxfish maneuver, that their shape was aerodynamic and self-stabilizing. However, analysis by scientists suggests that boxfish agility is instead due to the combination of an aerodynamically unstable body and the manner in which the fish use their fins for movement.[8]

Lythrypnus dalli, commonly known as the blue-banded goby or Catalina goby, is a species of goby. It is native to the eastern Pacific where it is found from Monterey Bay, California to northern Peru, including the Gulf of California.[1]  It can be found in coastal waters at depths of from 0 to 76 metres (0 to 249 ft) with rocky substrates in which there are crevices for concealment.  It is also known to hide amongst the spines of sea urchins.  It is a bidirectional hermaphrodite and capable of rapidly switching sexes.[2] This species can reach a length of 6.4 centimetres (2.5 in) TL. It can also be found in the aquarium trade.[3] The specific name honours the malacologist William Healey Dall (1845-1927), who when trawling for specimens off Catalina Harbour, California, caught one of the type specimens.[4]

The ring-tailed cardinalfish (Ostorhinchus aureus) is a widespread fish species in the family Apogonidae found in the Red Sea and off East Africa to Papua New Guinea, north to Japan, and south to Australia.[1]

O. semilineatus

O. gularis

O. apogonoides

O. aureus

O. flagelliferus

The French naturalist Philibert Commerson provided the first description of this fish from Réunion in the western Indian Ocean, but it was not published in a format allowing full citation. Therefore, the species name and description by Bernard Germain de Lacépède (who acknowledged Commerson) takes precedence, albeit with a nod to Commerson.[3] With no original or subsequent illustrations or specimens denoted as types, Fricke nominated a neotype in 1999 but subsequently withdrew it.[4]

This species has on occasion been mistakenly considered a junior synonym of the similar species Ostorhinchus fleurieu, but is generally acknowledged as separate; it had the junior species synonym roseipinnis applied by Georges Cuvier in 1829.[5]

Lacépède coined the genus Ostorhinchus in 1802[6] to which O. aureus was eventually assigned,[7] although he originally placed it in the genus Centropomus which is now placed in a different fish family, Centropomidae.

This fish is coppery-coloured with a broad blackish bar at the base of the tail, up to 14.5 cm in length.  The upper jaw has a narrow blue streak, and a broad blackish stripe extends from the front of the snout to the eye. Easily confused with Ostorhinchus fleurieu,[8] where the black tail bar does not narrow in the centre, but unlike this species, the stripe is also present in juveniles.

Internally, O. aureus is one of a large group of nocturnal feeding fishes which has a black pigmented gut lining, apparently to hide the glow of bioluminescent prey from its own piscivores in turn.[9] The eyes of O. aureus allow the transmission of ultraviolet light,[10] which if it is proven to be able to see, could benefit its nocturnal foraging.

Using a shorthand meristics formula, O. aureus can be described as having:

D, VII-I,9

A, II,8

P, 14

LL, 25

GR, 6-8 + 16-20[11]

Ostorhinchus aureus inhabits holes in rocks or under ledges in shallow waters. It is known to occur in mixed aggregates with Ostorhinchus apogonoides during summer and autumn, but form separate aggregates in winter and spring.[citation needed]

Whereas coral reef fish settlement tends to be dominated by larval recruitment, in at least part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, recruitment of O. aureus at any given coral reef patch tends to be by adult and juvenile migration across intervening sand and coral debris.[12]

O. aureus is subject to infection by tiny cnidarian parasites from class Myxosporea. Fish specimens have been found with gall bladder infections of Ceratomyxa apogoni, Ceratomyxa cardinalis,[13] and Ellipsomyxa apogoni,.[14] Three species have also been found in skeletal muscle cells: Kudoa cheilodipteri, Kudoa whippsi,[15] and Kudoa iwatai.[16]

O. aureus is a nocturnal predator; where seagrass is adjacent to its reef, it tends to venture out further than some other members of its family.[17]

Studies of stomach content show that O. aureus is a generalist predator, eating mainly planktonic and benthic crustaceans, but, unusually for its family, may at times also eat marine algae.[18]

O. aureus are external bearers, specifically mouthbrooders. Adults tend to pair whilst juveniles tend to aggregate during the day time.[19]

O. aureus is regularly kept by marine aquarists.[20]

Personal Aquariums

List of aspects that one should be aware of about having ring-tailed cardinalfish as a personal pet:

– This species needs hiding places. 

– This species can live with many of its own kind, when provided with enough space. 

– This species is nocturnal and therefore the most active when the light is dimmed or turned off. 

– This species might be a threat to smaller fishes, shrimps, crabs, etc.[21]

彩条玫瑰,Apogon cyanosoma,unk,鲈形目,"

Apogon cyanosoma Bleeker, 1853

Ostorhinchus cyanosoma, commonly known as the yellow-striped cardinalfish, goldenstriped cardinalfish, or the orange-lined cardinalfish,[1] is a species of marine fish in the cardinalfish family (family Apogonidae) of order Perciformes. It is native to the Indo-West Pacific.

O. cyanosoma is usually a blueish silver color with orange-yellow stripes, and grows to be an average of 6 centimeters. It lives in waters up to 50m in depth, often in lagoons or coral reefs. It is active during the nighttime, feeding on small plants and animals, mostly plankton. It has been the subject of research to test what might happen to marine life by the year 2100, due to predicted carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.

O. moluccensis

O. taeniophorus

O. selas

O. properuptus

O. cyanosoma

O. rubrimacula

O. holotaenia

O. luteus

The prolific Dutch East Indies-resident ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker first described this species in 1853 from a specimen taken at Lawajong off Solor Island in modern Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province.[3] His unique, original holotype is lodged at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands.[4]

No one has described a synonymous species, so Bleeker's original species name cyanosoma remains unchallenged. However, the genus Apogon which he placed it in masked significant differences between species. More recently, on the basis of physical (2005)[5] and genetic (2014)[2] characteristics, it has been transferred into the genus Ostorhinchus.

On the journey to dissecting the O. cyanosoma species complex[6] now incorporating O. cyanosoma, O. rubrimacula, O. wassinki, and O. properuptus, the last was for a while considered a synonym of O. cyanosoma.[7]

Large examples of Ostorhinchus cyanosoma grow to 8 cm in length[8] although its average length is 6 cm.[9] The fish is colored silver with a blueish tinge, and has six orange-yellow stripes including a short stripe behind the eye.[8]

A new species (Ostorhinchus rubrimacula) was separated out in 1998 from the O. cyanosoma species complex, with almost identical morphology but with a pinkish-red spot on the tail base,[6] and the genetics were confirmed in 2014.[2] Notably, whilst Bleeker noted red fins ('pinnis rubris') in his original sample, he never noted a red tail spot.[3]

Using a shorthand meristics formula,  O. cyanosoma can be described as having:

D, VII + I,9

A II,8

P, 14

LL, 24

The most comprehensive recent authority locates O. cyanosoma ranging across the Indo-Pacific, from the Red Sea south to east Africa, east via western Australia and Queensland to New Caledonia, and north to Ryukyu and Ogasawara islands.[8]

It lives in clear water areas of lagoons and shallow reefs, inhabiting waters from 1 to 50 meters (usually above 15m), and makes its home under ledges, in holes, and in between the spines of sea urchins.[9]

Coral reef fish settlement tends to be dominated by larval recruitment, but in at least part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, around one third of recruitment of O. cyanosoma at any given coral reef patch tends to be by adult and juvenile migration across intervening sand and coral debris.[10]

Within the large aggregations in which O. cyanosoma prefers, stable male-female pairs are often found. Individuals in pairs are more likely to live in one site, and to be able to return to that site if removed (with or without their partner), than are unpaired individuals.[11] Retaining a fixed spatial refuge on a reef may be a crucial factor in surviving the often ferocious piscivorous predation found there.[12]

O. cyanosoma specimens have been found with gall bladder infections of Ceratomyxa cyanosomae, Ceratomyxa cardinalis,[13] Ellipsomyxa apogoni, and Zschokkella ohlalae,.[14] Two species have also been found in skeletal muscle cells: Kudoa cheilodipteri and Kudoa whippsi.[15] These tiny cnidarian parasites from class Myxosporea are doubly fascinating because this group can require two intermediate hosts involving two sexual stages (an extremely rare phenomenon in the parasite world).

O. cyanosoma is mainly a nocturnal planktivore, emerging from hiding in coral caves and crevices to feed by hovering just above sandy microhabitats on coral reef flats. By defecating during the daytime in a non-feeding microhabitat, O. cyanosoma probably helps cycle reef nutrients around different communities on the reef. It appears to prefer to eat small benthic sergestid crustaceans rather than the planktonic larvae to be found higher in the water column.[16] However, seasonal or sampling effects may play a role in defining the diet, since in certain years, certain sites appear to suggest that O. cyanosoma is actually eating significant amounts of planktonic copepods and crustacean larvae.[17]

Although its wide mouth gape may be well suited to eating benthic prey, consumption of varying types of prey by cardinalfishes with different mouth shapes appears in reality to be better correlated with varying availability (i.e. many mouth shapes can still make generalist species).[18]

O. cyanosoma is a paternal mouthbrooder. This is likely to be a more important reason for the sexual dimorphism shown by the male's wider gape and more protruding lower jaw, than is its prey specificity. A bigger mouth allows for more eggs to be protected from predation, and for better water circulation (for oxygenation in both eggs and parent).[19]

Pair bonding in O. cyanosoma does not appear to provide the expected genetic benefits of monogamy, indeed like many pair bonding fishes in its family, predation seems to have driven it rather than reproductive exclusivity.[20]

Often stationary and visible low on the reef during the day time, aggregations of O. cyanosoma add to the captivating underwater pallette enjoyed by recreational Scuba divers,[21] whose presence also contributes significantly to local economies in often poorer tropical countries.[22]

Export of live specimens contributes to the enjoyment of marine aquarium hobbyists,[23] which if managed appropriately, can also benefit local, often poorer, communities.[24]

O. cyanosoma has been used as a laboratory experimental animal to test what might happen to marine life by the year 2100, given predicted atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide. It appears that the negative effects on fish metabolic rate (and related survival) of ocean acidification caused by extra carbon dioxide dissolution could be equivalent to an extra 3 °C of water temperature (which global warming is already causing).[25] Reef fish populations in higher (cooler) latitudes appear to have more capacity to cope with rising temperatures and acidification than those nearer the equator.[26]

Ostorhinchus compressus, commonly called the ochre-striped cardinalfish, blue-eyed cardinalfish or split banded cardinalfish, is a marine cardinalfish from the Indo-West Pacific from the family Apogonidae. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a size of 12 cm in length.

This fish was first described by Hugh McCormick Smith and Lewis Radcliffe after its collection during the 1907-1910 United States Bureau of Fisheries Albatross Philippines expedition.[2] The holotype (record number USNM 68398) is lodged at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.[3]

The genus Amia initially allocated by the authors subsequently proved to be a synonym of Ostorhinchus, making its way via Apogon.[4]

Although the maximum recorded standard length of O. compressus is 12 cm, its most common adult length is around 8.5 cm. Adults are pinkish-white, with six brown stripes along each side, iridescent blue eye rings, and up to four brown spots on the caudal peduncle (tail base). Juveniles begin with a black spot on a yellow caudal peduncle, which appears to mimic juveniles of certain piscivorous species of Cheilodipterus.[5]

Using a shorthand meristics formula,  O. compressus can be described as having:

D, VI-I,9

A II,9

P, 13-14

LL, 24

GR, 7-8 + 20-22[6]

Ostorhinchus compressus occurs in Australian waters from the Scott Reef, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, and Rowley Shoals in Western Australia; and from the Great Barrier Reef to the Middleton & Elizabeth Reefs Reserve and Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea. Its wider distribution extends through the Indo-Pacific from the Andaman Sea to Vanuatu and New Caledonia and as far north as southern Japan.[7]

Research on the larval stage of this species shows that as it develops, its ability to see in ultraviolet light increases. Given that the larval stage is pelagic, this implies that older larvae can migrate down the water column to feed.[8] This might improve its predator evasion, whilst improving its food intake.

Generally found from 2–20 metres, adults rest during the daytime in floating mixed species groups with other Apogonids. They are not very picky, being found resting in association with several kinds of live hard coral, Gorgonians, dead coral, rubble, and sand.[9] Possibly because of the low water circulation, higher temperatures, and high oxygen consumption of some of the shallow branching corals into which O. compressus retreats from predators, it has been found to tolerate very low dissolved levels of oxygen, even at a temperature of 30 °C (which is likely to stimulate a relatively high resting metabolic rate).[10]

The gills of O. compressus have been found infected with Gyrodactylid flatworms.[11]

The sailfin tang (Zebrasoma velifer), the Pacific sailfin tang, purple sailfinned tang or sailfin surgeonfish,  is a marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Acanthuridae which includes the surgeonfishes, unicornfishes and tangs. This fish is found in the Pacific Ocean and is popular in the aquarium hobby.

The sailfin tang was first formally described as Acanthurus velifer in 1795 by the German naturalist Marcus Elieser Bloch with its type locality given as Tranquebar in Bloch and Schneider 1801.[3] When William John Swainson proposed the new genus Zebrasoma in 1839 he classified Bloch's Acanthurus velifer as the only species in the genus, it is therefore the type species of Zebrasoma by monotypy.[4] The sailfin tang and the Indian sailfin tang *Z, desjardinii are closely related, and have been regarded as conspecific in the past,[5] and form a species pair which is basal to the genus Zebrasoma.[6] The genera Zebrasoma and Paracanthurus make up the tribe Zebrasomini within the subfamily Acanthurinae in the family Acanthuridae, according to the 5th edition of Fishes of the World.[7]

Zebrasoma velifer has the specific name velifer, which is a combination of velo, meaning ""sail"", and fero, meaning ""to bear"", a reference to the high dorsal fin.[8] Many authors give the name as veliferum but it is a noun in apposition so velifer is correct.[3]

The sailfin tang has its dorsal fin supported by 4 or 5 spines and between 29 and 33 soft rays while its anal fin is supported by 3 spins and 23 to 26 soft rays.[2] It has a disc shaped body with very high dorsal and anal fins and when its fins are fully extended, the total height of the fish is almost equal to its length. It also has the elongated snout typical of Zebrasoma.[9] This is a brownish coloured fish marked with wide greyish brown bars separated by narrower yellow bars. The dorsal and anal fins are dark greyish to brown marked with paler bands. The caudal fin varies in colour from greyish brown to yellow.[10] The white head is covered with yellow spots and there is a dark band running though the eye with the a second slightly paler band immediately to the rear of the eye. The bands on the head are also marked with yellow dots and lines.[9] Juvenile specimens look similar to the adult fish, but with more yellow colouring.[11] This species has a maximum published standard length of 40 cm (16 in).[2]

The sailfin tang is found in the Pacific Ocean. The westernmost occurrence is around Christmas Island, in the eastern Indian Ocean, and the eastern coast of Indo-China and it extends eastwards into the Pacific as far as the Pitcairn Islands and Hawaii, north to Japan and south to Australia and Rapa Iti. It is absent from the Marquesas Islands.[1] In Australia this species is found at Rottnest Island to the Montebello ISlands and around offshore reefs in Western Australia; Ashmore reef in the Timor Sea, the northern Great Barrier Reef south to Moreton Bay in Queensland, although juveniles reach Sydney. They are also found off Middleton Reef, Elizabeth Reef and Lord Howe Island.[10] The sailfin tang is benthopelagic and is found at depths down to 45 m (148 ft) on lagoon and seaward reefs. The juveniles are solitary and occur on coral and rocky sheltered reefs, although they may sometimes be found in turbid areas.[2]

The sailfin tang is typically solitary, although they may be found in pairs.[1] They graze on leafy algae. When compared to the less basal Zebrasoma species they have less well developed pharyngeal teeth. They are diurnal and courtship and spawning take place in the early afternoon following an ebbing tide.[2]

The sailfin tang is caught as a food fish, in Guam fishers use spears and fish traps. As it is larger than the sympatric congeners the yellow tang (Z. flavescens) and the twotone tang (Z. scopas), it is of greater value as a food fish. It is also traded in the aquarium trade.[1]

燕尾蓝魔,Chromis cyaneus,unk,鲈形目,"

Chromis cyanea (blue chromis) is a damselfish in the subfamily Pomacentrinae,[2] found in Bermuda, southern Florida and the Caribbean Sea.[1]

It is collected for the aquarium trade. 

Being a shallow water fish, the blue chromis is commonly found at depths of 3 to 5 m, but it can reach depths of 25 m below sea level. 

It's also been recorded at a depth of 60 m below sea level. 

It lives on the surface of reefs, but often swims in the water columns above the reefs to feed on plankton. 

It's a rather solitary species, seen alone or in small groups, and tends to stay close to the reefs. 

The younger fish stay near the bottom in order to avoid predators. 

The males maintain a solitary breeding territory. After breeding with multiple females, they guard the eggs until the planktonic larvae hatch.[2][1]

The blue chromis is largely collected for use in aquariums. 

There are no reliable numbers on the extent of this collecting, but damselfish make up the most intensely collected fish group, making up almost half of the aquarium trade.[1]

Besides the intense aquarium trade, the rapid expansion of lionfish in the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast, is the greatest threat to the blue chromis, as well as several other tropical fish native to the Caribbean. 

Furthermore, the loss of live corals could have a definite impact on the species, though this has yet to be investigated more closely.[1]

The blue chromis is assessed as ""Least Concern"" by the IUCN. 

Despite appearing only within an area of 2,500,000 km2, it is considered abundant within that area, without any known continuous decline in range or population numbers. 

It's collected for the aquarium trade, but not in great numbers. Despite this, a deeper study is required, to measure the impact of the decline in habitat quality in the Caribbean has on the species.[1]

The flameback angelfish (Centropyge aurantonotus), also known as the  flameback pygmy angelfish, Brazilian flameback angelfish, Caribbean flameback angelfish or fireball angelfish,  is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean.

The flameback angelfish has an oval, deep and laterally compressed body with a short, blunt snout and a small mouth. There is a long, robust spine at the angle of the preopercle with vertical margin serrated. To the rear of the bone below the eye there are 2 large, rear-pointing spines and a series of smaller spines on the preopercle and on the opercle.[2] It has a mainly blue body with the head and dorsal region being bright, golden yellow. It also has a blue ring around the eyes.[3] The caudal and the anal fins are dark blue marked with many black spots.[4] The dorsal fin contains 14-15 spines and 15-16 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 17 soft rays.[2] This species attains a maximum total length of 7.5 centimetres (3.0 in).[4]

The flameback angelfish is found in the tropical Western Atlantic Ocean. It occurs from the Lesser Antilles and Curaçao in the Netherlands Antilles and along the northern coast of South America from Venezuela to southern Brazil.[1] It has been recorded in the easatern Atlantic at São Tomé in the Gulf of Guinea.[5]

The flameback angelfish is found. At depths of between 15 and 300 metres (49 and 984 ft) where it is found in areas of reef and rock rubble.[1] It may also be common around isolated patches of staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis). It feels on algae and sponges.[4] Like other angelfish the flameback angelfish lays pelagic eggs and has pelagic larvae.[2]

The flameback angelfish was first formally described in 1974 by Warren E. Burgess with the type locality given as off Oistins in Barbados.[6] In some classifications it is placed in the subgenus Xiphipops.The specific name is a compound of aurantia meaning “orange” and notus meaning “back” and refers to the golden-orange back shown by this species.[7]

The flameback angelfish is popular in the aquarium trade and in the 20th Century thousands were exported from Brazil.[1]

Centropyge fisheri, the orange angelfish, whitetail angelfish, damsel angelfish, yellowtail angelfish, Hawaiian flame angelfish, Fisher’s angelfish, Fisher’s dwarf angelfish or Fisher’s pygmy angelfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific region.

Centropyge fisheri varies in colour from deep blue to orange-brown. The caudal fin is whitish to pale yellow and is almost transparent. The dorsal, anal and pelvic fins have vivid blue margins and there are blue streaks along the posterior edge of the dorsal and anal fins.[3] This species attains a maximum total length of 8.4 centimetres (3.3 in).[2]

Centropyge fisheri has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution. It is found on the East African coast in Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania across the Indian Ocean and into the Pacific Ocean as far as Hawaii and Johnston Atoll and Tuamotu. Its range extends north to southern Japan and south to the Great Barrier Reef.[1] In Australia it can be found at Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands as well as on the reefs off Western Australia, in the Timor Sea and on the east coast as far south as Cook Island in New South Wales while juveniles reach as far south as Bass Point.[3]

Centropyge fisheri is found at depths between 3 and 60 metres (9.8 and 196.9 ft).[1] It is a species of reefs where it can be found in the coral rich bottoms of channels, reef slopes and areas of rubble. It is frequently found in areas of brittle corals and coralline algae which it shares with damselfish and smaller wrasses.[2] It is typically encountered in small groups.[1] Its diet is mainly algae but some worms and crustaceans are consumed. [4] This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite, the dominant female in a group will change sex if there is no male. [5]

Centropyge fisheri was  first formally described as Holocanthus fisheri in 1904 by the American ichthyologist John Otterbein Snyder (1867-1943) with the type locality given as off Diamond Head on Oahu in Hawaii.[6] The specific name honours the zoologist Walter Kenrick Fisher (1878-1953) of Stanford University. Within the genus Centropyge this species is considered, by some authorities, to be in the subgenus Xiphypops.[7] C. fisheri was considered to be restricted to Hawaii but the more widespread C. flavicauda is now considered to be synonymous with it.[3]

工兵虾虎,pholidichthys leucotaenia,unk,鲈形目,"

Brotulophis argentistriatus Kaup, 1858[1]

Pholidichthys leucotaenia, commonly known as the convict blenny/goby or the engineer blenny/goby, is a marine fish from the west-central Pacific Ocean. Despite its common names, it is neither a blenny nor a goby, but is in fact one of two species in the family Pholidichthyidae.

A small eel-shaped fish, it can grow up to 60 cm (24 in) in length. Juveniles resemble the striped catfish Plotosus lineatus, which is venomous, having a black body with a white dorsal stripe. As they develop, the stripe changes to white convict-style barring or spotting in the adult.

P. leucotaenia lives in shallow lagoons and on coastal reefs from the Philippines to the Solomon Islands. It is often found in schools under ledges or around coral heads. These schools swim in such tight formations, they resemble a single organism. Occasionally, the species is found in the aquarium trade, where it is known for disrupting all but the most stable structures.[2]

DNA analyses show this species to be neither a blenny nor a goby, but part of a separate fish family, the Pholidichthyidae.[3]

In the Solomon Islands, researchers under Eugenie Clark found juveniles emerging from holes in the seafloor and adjoining coral reefs. By day, these juveniles swim up to 50 m (55 yd) from their home burrows to feed on plankton. At the end of the day, all returned to the burrows, remarkable and unique behaviour for larval fish.

Over the course of the first year in captivity, the engineer goby fry will gradually change color as it grows up to 1 cm per month.

While their young are out feeding, the parents  eject mouthfuls of debris from the burrows. In a single day as much as 3 kg  (6.6 lb) of sand might be collected and spat out of the hole by the parents.[4] Research has revealed a maze of tunnels and chambers totaling a length of some 6 m. At night, young fish dangle by their mouths from the roof of the tunnels by thin mucous threads.

Adults may grow to almost 60 cm (24 in),[3] but never leave the tunnels to feed. They frequently take in mouthfuls of juveniles and spit them out again. An inspection of adult stomachs showed only a green slime.[3]

雷达,nemateleotris magnifica,unk,鲈形目,"

Nemateleotris magnifica, known by a variety of common names including fire goby, magnificent fire fish, fire dartfish, or red fire goby, is a species of dartfish native to coral reefs of the Indian and Pacific oceans.[2]

Members of this species usually have a bright yellow head, merging into a white body, gradually shading into a red-orange tail. Their dorsal fins are very long, and the fish flicks it back and forth.[2] This is used as a signal to conspecifics.[3][4] As a full grown adult, it reaches a maximum length of 9 centimetres (3.5 in).[2]

Nemateleotris magnifica inhabits parts of the Indian and Pacific oceans. Specifically, it occurs as far west as the East African coast, in the Indian Ocean, to as far east as the Hawaiian Islands of the Pacific Ocean. Within the Pacific Ocean it occurs as far south as the Austral Islands, French Polynesia, to as far north as the Ryukyu Islands, Japan.[2]

It is an inhabitant of coral reefs where it can be found at depths of 6 to 70 metres (20 to 230 ft). It is usually found just above the bottom, facing into the current, where it awaits its prey of small invertebrates.[2] Adults occupy sandy burrows alone or in pairs, while the juveniles live in small groups. These fish are monogamous[2] and they will retreat to burrows if threatened.[3]

Nemateleotris magnifica feeds on brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, and sometimes zooplankton growing in aquaria. They should be fed two times per day. They are considered reef-safe and they are peaceful and sociable. They can be found at many online and local fish or pet stores; they are suitable for novice marine fishkeepers, although an appropriate tank is required as they sometimes jump from the water. They will also form schools if many are put into the same tank.[citation needed]

Nemateleotris helfrichi, Helfrich's Dartfish, is a species of dartfish native to the Pacific Ocean.

They are small fishes that grow to a maximum length of 6 centimetres (2.4 in).[2] They have bright yellow head with purple forehead with purple and white shades on body.[3] They have 7 dorsal spines 28-31 dorsal soft rays and 1 anal spine   26-28 anal soft rays.[4]

They are present in the Pacific Ocean between latitudes 16°N and  28°S. Their range extends from Indonesia to Tuamotu Archipelago. They prefer deeper waters than other Nemateleotris. They are found swimming a few meters above the water bed. They are found at a depths between and are rarely found above 40 metres (130 ft).[4]

They are carnivorous. N. helfrichi mainly feed on zooplanktons, amphipods, copepods, small crustaceans and shrimp larvae.[5] They are said to lose their bright colour if their dietary requirements are not met.[6]

The species is monogamous and are usually found in pairs.[4][7] They are territorial and will fight with conspecifics unless they are a pair.[3][8][9] The species is shy and hides in small caves when threatened.[9]

Due to their bright colour they are very popular as a marine aquarium fish. They are also more delicate and rare form than other more common firefish species (as evidenced by their price) and should be kept by marine-aquarists of intermediate expertise or higher.

The specific name honours Philip Helfrich, an Emeritus Director and Researcher, Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (University of Hawaii), and the director of the Eniwetok Marine Biological Laboratory, who collected some of the first specimens of this species.[10]

Its common names include the blueband goby, golden-head sleeper goby, and pennant glider.[1] It is native to the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean where it can be found in outer lagoons and the seaward side of reefs. It occurs in a variety of substrates, sand, rubble, hard, at depths of from 1 to 25 metres (3.3 to 82.0 ft) (usually at less than 6 metres (20 ft)). It primarily inhabits burrows dug under rubble, using them as both a nesting site and a refuge from predators. Such burrows typically have two entrances; however, only one of them is open, as the other is covered by rubble, sand, and algae.[2] It can also be found in the aquarium trade. This species can reach a length of 18 centimetres (7.1 in) TL.[3] It is the type species of the genus Valenciennea.[4]

Amblyeleotris wheeleri, the Gorgeous prawn-goby, is a species of goby native to tropical reefs of the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean.  It can be found at depths of from 5 to 40 metres (16 to 131 ft) though  is usually does not occur deeper than 15 metres (49 ft).  It is a commensal with alpheid shrimps, most often being found in association with Alpheus ochrostriatus.  This species can reach a length of 10 centimetres (3.9 in) SL.  It can also be found in the aquarium trade.[2]

The specific name honours the English ichthyologist Alwynne Cooper Wheeler (1929-2005), who was curator of Fishes at the British Museum (Natural History), ""for his help over the years, particularly with the authors’ study of prawn-associated gobies of the Seychelles"".[3]

The yellow prawn-goby (Cryptocentrus cinctus) is a species of goby native to the Western Pacific, where it can be found at depths of from 1 to 25 metres (3.3 to 82.0 ft) in coastal bays and lagoons.  This species is symbiotic with alpheid shrimps. They share burrows with these shrimp. [2]The species can reach a length of 10 centimetres (3.9 in) SL.[3]   These fish vary greatly in appearance, ranging from brilliant yellow to gray and even brown forms or combinations of each coloring.[4] This species is often kept in salt water aquariums. The yellow prawn-goby can be kept in aquariums as small as 20 gallons (75 L). In the marine hobby they are often partnered with tiger pistol shrimp.[5]

Valenciennea helsdingenii is a species of goby from the Indo-Pacific. It is commonly known as the twostripe goby, black-lined sleeper goby, or railway sleeper goby. It can grow up to a length of 25 cm (9.8 in) and is distinguishable by two prominent orange to black lines running longitudinally through its body.

Twostripe gobies were first described by the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in 1858 as Eleotriodes helsdingenii. The type specimens were originally collected from Pulau-Pulau Gorong, Maluku, Indonesia. It belongs to the hover goby genus Valenciennea in the true goby family, Gobiidae.[2] The specific name honours the Dutch civil servant W. F. C. van Helsdingen, who provided Bleeker with a number of well-preserved fish specimens from the Gorong Archipelago in the Dutch East Indies, including the type specimen of this species.[3]

The body of twostripe gobies is elongated and laterally compressed.[4] They are commonly 18 cm (7.1 in) in length, with a maximum length of 25 cm (9.8 in).[2][5] The body is predominantly white to pale gray in color, with the dorsal surface a darker brownish gray. It has two prominent orange, dark red, reddish-brown, or black lines running longitudinally on the sides of its body, darkest at the anterior end and growing lighter towards the back. The upper line begins from the front of the snout, goes through the eye, and ends at the tip of the upper fork of the caudal fin. The lower line is parallel to the upper line and begins from the side of the upper lip, through the middle of the base of pectoral fins, and ends at the tip of the lower fork of the caudal fin. Both upper and lower lines are outlined in white at the caudal fin. A large oval black spot is also present between the third and fifth spines of the dorsal fin.[4]

The pelvic fins are completely separated, no membrane is present between the first and the second dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is shallow and its margin rounded, and the fourth spine is slightly longer than the other spines.[4] The caudal fin in adults is deeply notched with two long filaments. Juveniles have more rounded caudal fins.[2]

Twostripe gobies are relatively rare. They usually occur in pairs, but can be found alone in silty flat sand patches or rubble substrates.[6] They are usually found on outer reefs at the bottom of coral or rocky dropoffs, rarely in lagoons. They feed on small digging (fossorial) organisms by sifting them from mouthfuls of sand.[7]

Eggs hatch two days after spawning and the larvae reach lengths of 5.25 mm (0.207 in) after 35 days.[7] Juveniles are usually found near rocks in clear estuaries.[2]

The fish is carnivore, feeding on small invertebrates.[6]

Twostripe gobies have a wide distribution range. They can be found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. From the coast of East Africa, the southern Red Sea, the Maldives, southeast India and Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, Australia, western Oceania, and Japan.[2][4]

Cirrhilabrus ryukyuensis is a wrasse from the western Pacific Ocean from Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines north to Japan. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a size of 15 cm in length.[1] Some authorities regard this taxon as a synonym of Cirrhilabrus cyanopleura,[2] but Fishbase[1] and the Catalog of Fishes treat it as a valid species.[3] This species was called Cirrhilabrus lyukyuensis but this is treated as a misspelling.[3]

Pseudochromis diadema Lubbock & Randall, 1978

Pictichromis diadema, the bicolor dottyback, diadem dottyback, or purple-top dottyback is a fish species of the dottyback family. It is a popular aquarium fish species.

This species is found in rich coral reefs in the western central Pacific Ocean, eastern Malay Peninsula, and western Philippine waters. They are found as close as 5 metres (16 ft) to the surface and as far down as 30 m (98 ft). They are native in 4 countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand.[citation needed]

This species is usually yellow in colour with a magenta stripe running along its back. In the wild, they grow to a reported 6 centimetres (2.4 in).

Their diet in the wild is only known to consist of crustaceans.

These fish are capable of changing their sex. After eggs are laid, the male aerates them by picking them up in his mouth. In the wild, they defend a territory several yards in diameter.[citation needed]

Pictichromis diadema is the first dottyback to be kept in captivity. They are widely sold for the aquarium trade. A very skittish addition to any aquarium, one should be wary to keep this species with other fish of similar sizes; if the Pictichromis diadema is the bigger, he will attack them, whereas if he is the smaller, he will hide most of the time.[citation needed]
